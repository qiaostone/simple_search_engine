</p><p>	Chinaâs National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has launched a regulatory app for cosmetics which enables people to search for information, read articles, and make complaints about and report relevant illegal activities, a WeChat account of China Youth Daily (IDï¼zqbcyol) reported Monday.
</p><p>	The app was introduced to the public on May 20 by Chen Feng, vice director of the information center of NMPA, at the first national cosmetics safety-themed event held by NMPA in Beijing.
</p><p>	The app is called âHua Zhuang Pin Jian Guanâ in Chinese, and can be literally translated as âcosmetics supervision and regulationâ. People can search for relevant information about various cosmetics by scanning the bar codes on the products or by searching the product names.
</p><p>	Users of the app can read about cosmetics and get other information about the industry, including notices and new developments in supervisory and regulatory efforts concerning cosmetics.
</p><p>	Users are also encouraged to report relevant illegal activities via the app.
</p><p>	The new app has sparked discussion on Chinaâs major social media platforms, with many people commenting that the app is necessary, convenient and useful.</p>"</body>
