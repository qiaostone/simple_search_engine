<h2>Male midwife delivers over 600 babies in SW China
</h2>

<hr/><p>	A male midwife has delivered over 600 babies in southwest China's Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children since he started working there in 2016.
</p><p>	Li Yunlong, the 26-year-old midwife, became an ICU nurse in an affiliated hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine after graduating from college, but soon quit his job.
</p><p>	"Back then, I dealt with critical patients every day. I was overwhelmed by death. That's why I decided to become a midwife, so I could welcome new lives," Li said.
</p><p>	"Delivering babies is the happiest thing in my life," he added with a smile.
</p><p>	Though refused by some prenatal women at first, Li has won recognition thanks to his sensitivity and humor. Some expectant mothers have even explicitly asked for Li's help.
</p><p>	"It is energy-consuming during delivery as we may need to lift and transfer patients. Since men are stronger than women, we can be more efficient in this regard," said Li.
</p><p>	As China has begun to implement the two-child policy, there is now a higher demand for midwives. The ratio of male midwives will continue to rise, said an official at Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children. (Photo/People's Daily Online)</p>"</body>
