<h2>Two-seat J-15 fighter jet boosts carrier capability: experts
</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Global Times)    08:03, December 13, 2018
</p>
<hr/><p>	A modified two-seat variant of the J-15 fighter jet was spotted at a Chinese aircraft carrier training base in a recent TV program, suggesting the carrier-based warplane is already being tested and expected to greatly expand the carrier's combat capability with electronic warfare equipment that one pilot cannot manage.
</p><p>	The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy only operates the single-seat J-15 fighter jet on the Liaoning aircraft carrier at the moment, but military analysts predict the two-seat variant of the warplane would be able to join the ranks within two years.
</p><p>	The new fighter jet, which resembles the J-15 but with a larger cockpit, was seen parked in a hangar at an unspecified Chinese carrier-based aircraft training base in a Sunday China Central Television (CCTV) program.
</p><p>	CCTV's website, cctv.com, published a separate report on Tuesday titled "China's most mysterious carrier-based fighter jet quietly appears, greatly accelerating the pace of aircraft carrier's combat capability," saying the aircraft in the program is a modified two-seat version of the J-15.
</p><p>	The variant might already be undergoing tests with the PLA Navy, the cctv.com report said.
</p><p>	It is painted with military camouflage instead of the flight test color, which further supports the guess, military experts said.
</p><p>	Modifying the single-seat J-15 into a two-seat version can greatly increase the combat capability of the fighter jet and the aircraft carrier, cctv.com reported.
</p><p>	The new aircraft can also conduct electronic jamming missions, the report said.
</p><p>	In April, photos of the variant equipped with wingtip electronic warfare pods surfaced online, but their authenticity could not be verified.
</p><p>	A single pilot cannot manage to fly the jet and engage in complicated electronic battles at the same time, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
</p><p>	The extra seat can also be used to train new pilots, the cctv.com report said.
</p><p>	Wei said that having an experienced pilot to teach a trainee in actual flight is very effective and will contribute to the talent program, noting that the control panels for both pilots are the same.
</p><p>	However, having an extra pilot means the variant might need to reduce its payload or sacrifice mobility, Wei said.
</p><p>	We noted that it is better to combine the strengths of the single-seat and two-seat versions to compensate for their weaknesses.</p>"</body>
