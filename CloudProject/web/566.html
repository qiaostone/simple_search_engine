<h2>U.S. military considers keeping 1,000 soldiers in Syria: report
</h2>

</p>
<hr/><p>	WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military is mulling about leaving up to 1,000 troops in Syria, further drifting away from President Donald Trump's original plan of a total withdrawal, said U.S. media on Sunday.
</p><p>	The troops will be deployed from northern Syria to the south, continuing to work with Kurdish fighters, reported the Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous administration officials.
</p><p>	The U.S. officials said the number of Western troops to be left in Syria is still to be decided.
</p><p>	Meanwhile, Washington plans to withdraw hundreds of American forces when "the last bastion of Islamic State is seized," a move that will be in accord with Trump's original plan, according to the report.
</p><p>	On Feb. 21, the White House announced that the United States would leave about 200 troops in Syria after the planned pullout. Trump confirmed the next day that a small fraction of U.S. forces would remain in Syria with troops from other countries.
</p><p>	Citing a senior administration official, U.S. media later reported that the U.S. military would leave about 400 troops in two different regions of Syria.
</p><p>	Currently, there are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
</p><p>	Declaring victory over the Islamic State, Trump last December announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, leading to the resignation of then U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis.</p>"</body>
