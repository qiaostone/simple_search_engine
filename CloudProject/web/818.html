<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday refuted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's criticism over China's participation in Arctic affairs, stressing that China would not be absent on trans-regional and global issues concerning the Arctic.
</p><p>	China can, and is ready to, play a constructive role on such issues, spokesman Geng Shuang told a press briefing, noting that the Arctic issues not only involve Arctic countries but also have global significance.
</p><p>	"China will not interfere in the affairs that purely belong to the Arctic countries," said Geng.
</p><p>	He stressed that China has always adhered to the principle of openness, cooperation and mutual benefits while taking part in Arctic affairs.
</p><p>	"On the Arctic issue, China has always stressed the importance of scientific research, advocate environmental conservation, reasonable utilization, law-based governance and international cooperation," he said. "We are neither playing a geopolitical game nor making an exclusive small circle."
</p><p>	China is willing to work with all sides to contribute to the peace, tranquility and sustainable development in the Arctic, according to the spokesperson.
</p><p>	Pompeo said China appeared to have national security aims in the Arctic, which had to be watched closely, as he arrived in Finland for a meeting of the Arctic Council.
</p><p>	The criticisms made by the U.S. official "were totally incorrect" and "had ulterior motives," said Geng.</p>"</body>
