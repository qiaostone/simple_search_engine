</p><p>	China established the state service center for veterans on Tuesdayï¼February 26thï¼, which aims to support veterans' employment, improve their welfare and guarantee their rights and interests.
</p><p>	The service center for ex-servicemen will mainly help them find jobs or start up their own businesses, and assist them with preferential treatments.
</p><p>	The service center for veterans will be fully established at all levels from provinces to villages in China, which reflects the government's increasing attention on the placement of ex-servicemen after the Ministry of Veterans Affairs was set up in 2018.
</p><p>	China is now paying more attention to helping ex-servicemen with new jobs. For example, of the veterans who accepted government placement, more than 80 percent have been given new positions in government organs, public institutions and state-owned companies. More than 80,000 former military officers were offered civilian jobs and over 400,000 retired soldiers were resettled in 2018 by local governments, said Wang Zhiming, a spokesman for the ministry at a January press conference. </p>"</body>
