<hr/><p>	CHENGDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A wild giant panda was spotted by infrared cameras in the Jiudingshan Nature Reserve in Mianzhu city, southwest China's Sichuan Province, the nature reserve said Wednesday.
</p><p>	It was the first time a camera has captured a wild panda in Mianzhu, said Liao Liang, who works at one of the nature reserve's management station.
</p><p>	Two videos with the animal were shot on April 1 and three pictures were taken the second day. The videos showed an adult wild panda with a muddy butt, weighing between 80 to 150 kg, strolling through a bamboo forest, alternating between looking around and eating.
</p><p>	"These images show that vegetation and the ecological environment in the area are improving, with good living conditions for pandas," Liao said.
</p><p>	To better acquire wildlife data, five infrared cameras were placed in the reserve in April 2018, with 35 others added last month.
</p><p>	The cameras also spotted other rare animal species under first- and second-class state protection in the area, including the golden snub-nosed monkey, the gnu, and the forest musk deer.
</p><p>	As of early last July, Mianzhu authorities have shut down 243 mines on the mineral-rich Jiudingshan Mountain where mining activities had taken a toll on the environment, and an area of more than 100,000 square meters has become green again.
</p><p>	Further efforts will be made to restore wildlife habitats and the ecological environment, Mianzhu authorities said.</p>"</body>
