</p>
<hr/><p>	BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on Sunday announced the launches of three stem cell clinic research programs to treat severe eye and gynecological diseases.
</p><p>	The three registered programs will focus on treating retinal pigment degeneration, ovarian dysfunction, and intrauterine adhesions that affect women health.
</p><p>	China has a total of 35 stem cell clinic research programs that have been registered by the National Health Commission and the National Medical Products Administration.
</p><p>	Human embryonic stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into a variety of cell types, which can participate in cell replacement and tissue regeneration. In recent years, stem cell research has become a key frontier area in the medical field, showing a good development prospect for the treatment of some difficult diseases.
</p><p>	Xiangli Bin, vice president of the CAS, said the academy's institute of stem cell and regenerative medicine has led 10 stem cell research programs, accounting for nearly one-third of the total registered in the country. The institute has made progress in clinical research, industrial transformation, and standardization.
</p><p>	The CAS, China's highest academic institution in natural sciences, also revealed the progress of ongoing stem cell programs for Parkinson's disease, vision loss and knee injury.</p>"</body>
