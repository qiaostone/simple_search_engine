<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Haidian District, the capital's tech hub, is seeking to expand its lead in self-driving vehicles with a plan to create more spaces for tests.
</p><p>	The district will build a demonstration area with 100 square kilometers for self-driving vehicles, said Dai Binbin, head of the Haidian District Government.
</p><p>	The demonstration area is part of a 15-point action plan issued by the district government to spur the development and innovation of driverless vehicles and smart connected cars.
</p><p>	The area will be a place to develop smart connected cars and smart transportation through featuring multiple scenarios, cloud management, simulated tests and data support, said Dai.
</p><p>	Companies and researchers will be able to test technologies in commuting, logistics and delivery and road cleaning, he said.
</p><p>	Haidian District seeks to step up international cooperation in the industry and plans to host a high-level competition of driverless vehicles, Dai said.
</p><p>	In March 2018, Beijing earmarked 33 roads with a total length of 105 km for autonomous car testing in Yizhuang, Shunyi and Haidian, all of which are outside the Fifth Ring Road and away from densely-populated areas.
</p><p>	Haidian is home to the Zhongguancun Science Park, dubbed the capital's tech hub.</p>"</body>
