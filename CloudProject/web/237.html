<hr/><p>
</p><p>	Coordinated by Peopleâs Daily, the Belt and Road News Network (BRNN) kicked off its first council meeting in Beijing on Tuesday, with a total of 40 influential media outlets from 25 countries invited as council members.
</p><p>	The meeting, which was held two days ahead of the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF), is a positive response to Chinese President Xi Jinpingâs proposal at the first BRI forum in 2017, when he suggested that a BRI news alliance should be established. After two years, 182 media outlets from 86 countries have signed up to the BRNN, serving as a significant platform to further strengthen people-to-people exchanges along the Belt and Road.
</p><p>	Peopleâs Daily Online has invited several foreign media representatives to talk about their expectation on future media cooperation under the framework of the BRI.</p>"</body>
