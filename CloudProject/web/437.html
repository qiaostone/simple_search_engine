<h2>Interview: China's achievements of 40 years' reform, opening-up remarkable, Russian Communist leader says
</h2>

<hr/><p>	MOSCOW, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- China has scored remarkable achievements with global significance since it adopted the policy of reform and opening-up 40 years ago, said Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</p><p>	In a recent interview with Xinhua, Zyuganov recalled that for China, the beginning of the 20th century was a time of suffering and humiliation.
</p><p>	"A huge country with a history of many thousands of years, which gave the world masterpieces of culture and art, languished under the burden of semi-colony. Foreign predators tore the country apart, plundering its wealth," he said.
</p><p>	In 1949, an event of world significance happened -- the People's Republic of China was founded and the Chinese people began to build socialism, he said, adding that China, however, continued to face serious difficulties, mainly poverty.
</p><p>	Zyuganov said the reform and opening-up has made it possible for China to solve the problem and about 740 million people were brought out of poverty over the past 40 years.
</p><p>	"It is deeply symbolic that a decisive contribution to the struggle against poverty on a global scale was made by a country that does not abandon the socialist path of development," the Communist leader said.
</p><p>	Meanwhile, China has set medium- and long-term development goals, he added, brushing away Western doubt that China might fail to attain them.
</p><p>	"China is developing despite the malicious statements of ill-wishers who predict a 'hard landing,' if not a collapse. The best answer to such slander is Beijing's success," he said.
</p><p>	In his eyes, high-tech industries are developing at the fastest pace in China today. He said that almost every day he hears news about China's achievements in science and technology.
</p><p>	"A very important result of the policy of reform and opening-up is that it actually goes beyond the borders of the country," Zyuganov said.
</p><p>	In his view, modern China is not just a full-fledged member of the world community but also a country that has an increasing influence on global stage.
</p><p>	As a leader in industrial development, a major global trader and a country with an economic growth rate about twice the world average, China is the leading driver of the global economy, he said.
</p><p>	"It is extremely important to note that China does not talk with other countries from a position of strength," but instead it builds relationships in such a way that cooperation becomes beneficial for all parties, he said.
</p><p>	"It does not demand political concessions in exchange for economic assistance. It does not blackmail nor threaten," added Zyuganov.</p>"</body>
