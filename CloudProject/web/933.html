Lin Fusheng, a villager from Hualian Village of Huashan Township in Lichuan County, suffered from physical disability because of infantile paralysis. Despite that, Lin stuck with his dream of becoming a painter. As Lichuan County witnessed rapid development of oil painting industry in 2013, Lin returned to his hometown and grew as a professional painter with the help of local government. Now Lin owns a studio at an oil painting creative industrial park, by which he earns over 30,000 yuan (4,336 U.S. dollars) per year. (Xinhua/Hu Chenhuan)</p>"</body>
