<h2>3D-printed electrical room starts operation in southern China

<hr/><p>	GUANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A power distribution room built with 3D printing technology has started operation in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong Province.
</p><p>	The electrical room, the first of its kind nationwide, measures 12.1 meters long, 4.5 meters wide and 4.6 meters high. It was built using a 3D printer according to a digital 3D model, said Wu Xiaofei with the power supply bureau in Guangzhou.
</p><p>	Wu said construction of the room started last December and took a total of 35 days to complete, cutting the normal construction time by 30 percent.
</p><p>	The printer only required one operator and two other workers to assist with the printing, while manual construction of the room usually requires more than five workers, he added.
</p><p>	Besides, the printer reduced the dust and waste produced during the construction.
</p><p>	3D printing technology will be used as an efficient, intelligent and eco-friendly way for construction as Guangzhou is ramping up efforts to expand its power supply networks, Wu said.</p>"</body>
