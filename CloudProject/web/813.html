The Mirwais Regional Hospital, locally known as the "Chinese Hospital", was built by China in 1974 and put into operation in 1979 on 44 acres of land in Kandahar, the largest city in the southern region as a gift to the Afghan people. The hospital is the largest health center in Afghanistan's southern region and provides almost all kinds of services to patients ranging from diagnosis of diseases to surgery of war victims, childcare and maternity.
