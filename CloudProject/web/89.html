<hr/><p>	BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Zheng Mengzhu, Chinese mainland's first test-tube baby, gave birth to a boy on Monday morning, according to the Peking University Third Hospital.
</p><p>	Zheng was born on March 10, 1988 in the hospital with the help of Zhang Lizhu, a leading doctor of test tube baby research at the hospital.
</p><p>	Zheng gave birth to a boy on 8:34 a.m. on Monday through a cesarean section, said Zhao Yangyu, a doctor who performed the surgery. The boy weighed 3,850 grams.
</p><p>	The baby was in a horizontal position when he was in the womb, a situation that demanded a C-section, Zhao said.
</p><p>	"The surgery went rather well. Both the mother and the baby are in stable condition," she said.
</p><p>	Qiao Jie, head of the hospital, said the successful birth of Zheng's child marks another milestone in the history of assisted reproduction in China.
</p><p>	China's test tube baby technology has reached leading levels in the world, she said.</p>"</body>
