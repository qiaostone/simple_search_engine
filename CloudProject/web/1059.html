<h2>China standardizes R&D spending statistics
</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Xinhua)    08:20, May 08, 2019
</p>
<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has published a document to standardize the data of research and experimental development (R&D) spending.
</p><p>	The new standard is expected to increase the quality of R&D statistics, and make the data comparable internationally, the NBS said in an online statement.
</p><p>	Relevant departments and local officials should strictly adhere to the standard and conduct surveys and data evaluations under unified rules, the statement said.
</p><p>	The document came as China is seeing an increasing number of R&D activities amid the country's shift toward an innovation-driven economy.
</p><p>	China's R&D spending increased to 2.18 percent of its GDP last year, up by 0.06 percentage points, previous NBS data showed.
</p><p>	The new standard is based on China's realities, meets the country's developmental needs, and accords with international standard to enhance international comparison, the NBS said.
</p><p>	R&D-related indexes indicate the technological capability, especially the self-innovation capability, of a country or a region.
</p><p>	China published the first document on R&D standard in 2000, which significantly contributed to assessing the country's technological progress.</p>"</body>
