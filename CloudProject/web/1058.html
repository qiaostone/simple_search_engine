<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities closed the websites of nine illegal social organizations and banned their public accounts on social media platforms Wechat and Weibo in accordance with the law, the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA) said Tuesday.
</p><p>	The campaign was jointly carried out by the MCA and cyberspace affairs as well as telecom authorities, following reports that websites of some illicit social organizations that had been prohibited were still in operation.
</p><p>	The MCA and the Ministry of Public Security had launched a crackdown on illegal social organizations between last April and December. A total of 5,845 had been investigated and handled and over 300 suspected ones exposed.
