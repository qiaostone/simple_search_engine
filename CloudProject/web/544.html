<h2>Apple steps up efforts in India as it takes on lower-priced Chinese smartphones
</h2>

<hr/><p>	Apple Inc is striving to expand in the Indian market, but industry experts noted that it will be difficult for Apple to catch up there with a group of Chinese mobile brands in the short term due to Chinese rivals' advantage in pricing.
</p><p>	Apple has finalized a shortlist of locations for its first retail store in India, in a bid to make its foray into the world's fastest-growing smartphone market and improve its business amid a loss of market share in China, reported Bloomberg on Wednesday.
</p><p>	Local consumers in India prefer more affordable quality Chinese brands such as Xiaomi and Vivo. But as Apple keeps losing market share in China, its CEO has made a commitment to improve sales in India, said the report.
</p><p>	"It is hard for a relatively high-end mobile brand like Apple to adjust its production strategy to deal with the relatively lower-level consumption market in India," Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based senior industry analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday. Lower production costs are still the main reason for giant manufacturers to move to India, Liu noted.
</p><p>	Even though it's the fastest-growing smartphone market, the consumption level in India still needs time to develop, and the relatively high-priced iPhone models can hardly beat Chinese mobile brands in the near future, Wang Yanhui, secretary-general of the Mobile China Alliance, told the Global Times on Sunday.
</p><p>	In the first quarter of 2019, Chinese smartphone brands led by Xiaomi and Vivo held a dominant record 66 percent share of the Indian market, a Hong Kong-based industry analysis firm.
</p><p>	Apple's revenue in India is not disclosed separately by the company.
</p><p>	In the first quarter of this year, it was lumped together with the "rest of the Asia-Pacific" area, which accounted for only 6 percent of total revenue. </p>"</body>
