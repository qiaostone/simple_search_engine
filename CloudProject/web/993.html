<hr/><p>	On May 12, the Shenzhen Education Bureau issued results from an investigation into "gaokao immigrants" at Shenzhen Fuyuan School. The announcement stated that 32 students who had enrolled in the 2019 gaokao were confirmed as "gaokao immigrants", meaning they should have enrolled in other provinces or schools where their hukou or student status had been registered. The students involved have since been disqualified from sitting the gaokao, the national college entrance examination.

</p><p>	Furthermore, the Shenzhen Fuyuan School enrollment plan is to be halved this year, as punishment for its violation. The school is also required to deal with those responsible for the issue and rectify any existing problems.
</p><p>	The incident was exposed on April 28 when parents found out that six out of the top 10 students in a mock gaokao exam came from Shenzhen Fuyuan School, which is known for its mediocre gaokao results.
</p><p>	On May 8, Jing Lihu, director of the Guangdong Provincial Education Department, responded that all students from outside Guangdong should return to their areas of residence, where their hukou or student status is registered, to sit the exam. If they do not comply, their gaokao scores will be canceled.
</p><p>	In an interview with China Daily, one parent from Shenzhen said: "It is unfair for local students if students from outside Guangdong participate in our Gaokao examinations."
</p><p>	"The students who achieve high scores in the gaokao and are enrolled at prestigious universities will occupy places at Chinese universities and colleges which are meant for local students," the parent added.
