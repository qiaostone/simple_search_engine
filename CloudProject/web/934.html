</p><p>	The world's first 3D printed cervical intervertebral disc replacement operation was successfully completed in Northwest China and hailed by experts on Sunday as a milestone in combining high technology with clinical medicine.
</p><p>	Doctors at Honghui Hospital, Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province, used a cervical intervertebral disc produced by a 3D printer to replace the impaired cervical intervertebral disc of a patient, the first for this body part in the world, the Xi'an Daily reported on Friday.
</p><p>	Surgeon Qian Lixiong told the Global Times on Sunday they first took a CT scan of the patient and then designed a personalized prosthesis based on the image data.
</p><p>	"The 3D printed cervical intervertebral disc replacement method is a breakthrough in clinical medicine practice," Qian said.

</p><p>	Most hospitals in China use an imported prosthesis that costs at least 60,000 yuan ($8,673) and whose design is based on foreign people.
</p><p>	The 3D version costs about 40,000 yuan and is personalized according to the patient's image data, making it more compatible with Chinese patients.
</p><p>	"We're going to promote and popularize the technology if later research verifies the incidence rate of using a 3D artificial cervical disc is slower than that of using the imported prostheses," Qian said.</p>"</body>
