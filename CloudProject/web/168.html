</p><p>	BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced that a Sino-European joint space mission known as SMILE was launched Friday.
</p><p>	The Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer is a comprehensive collaboration between the CAS and the European Space Agency (ESA). Satellites will be launched by 2023 to study the impact of solar activity on the Earth's environment.
</p><p>	Wang Chi, director of National Space Science Center under the CAS, said the SMILE program would create images of interaction between solar winds and the Earth's magnetosphere with innovative X-ray and ultraviolet technologies.
</p><p>	It will achieve an overall imaging of large-scale structure of the Earth's space, which plays an important role in predicting and mitigating weather disasters, according to Wang.
</p><p>	SMILE has gathered the world's leading resources in space weather. The UK Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency will also participate.
</p><p>	China and Europe are responsible for the construction and operation of the application system. The data obtained by satellites in orbit will be available to all participating countries.</p>"</body>
