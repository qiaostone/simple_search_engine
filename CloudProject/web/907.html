</p><p>	Up to 78.63 percent of Chinese companies listed the EU as their top investment target, according to a report released by the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). Meanwhile, the report also called for a better investment environment in the EU market.
</p><p>	Chinese firms had set up over 2,900 ventures in the EU by the end of 2017, covering 28 EU members, said the CCPIT report.
</p><p>	Chinese enterprises brought capital as well as job opportunities to the EU, which helped boost the blocâs economy under the slowing projected economic growth within the eurozone.
</p><p>	The report also pointed out that the EU and some of its member states have begun to tighten their foreign investment reviews, with some countries substantially raising their threshold for market access, increasing compliance costs, and making it difficult for Chinese enterprises to operate, CCPIT noted.
</p><p>	The report noted that the EU should pay attention to the challenges Chinese enterprises face and the wish for a better investment environment, which can be achieved through ensuring policy transparency, establishing explanations for its review system, enhancing law-based administration and improving service capability.</p>"</body>
