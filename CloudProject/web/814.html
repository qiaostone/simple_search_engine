</p><p>	ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that he is worried about Turkey's plans to deploy the Russian S-400 missile defense system despite of U.S. objection.
</p><p>	"The purchase of any equipment is the decision of each NATO ally," Stoltenberg said in a joint news conference with the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in the capital Ankara.
</p><p>	"But I am concerned about the potential consequences of the decision to buy S-400. Because the U.S. has made it clear to impose sanctions," he added.
</p><p>	Meanwhile, Stoltenberg welcomed Turkey's key role in NATO's training mission in Iraq.
</p><p>	NATO helps protect Turkey with air and missile defense systems and enhanced patrols by Turkey's Airborne Warning and Control System surveillance planes, he said.
</p><p>	"Over the years, NATO has invested more than 5 billion U.S. dollars in military facilities in Turkey," the secretary general said, adding that this included important infrastructure such as airfields, naval bases, and radar sites.
</p><p>	Recalling that Turkey proposed to establish a joint working group in order to eliminate hesitations of NATO and the U.S. over its purchase of S-400 systems, Cavusoglu said that "the U.S. would accept our proposal if it is sincere with these concerns."
</p><p>	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly said that Turkey won't step back from the S-400 deal, despite mounting pressure from Washington, including sanctions threats.</p>"</body>
