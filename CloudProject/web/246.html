<hr/><p>	VIENTIANE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The new 500 kV and 230 kV transmission lines to be installed in Laos' capital Vientiane, a joint project between Lao and Chinese companies, will ensure more Lao people to have sufficient power, officials here have said.
</p><p>	The new power lines will transmit electricity from hydropower dams for use in Vientiane as well as for sale to other countries, local daily Vientiane Times reported on Monday, quoting managing director of the Lao state-run Electricite du Laos (EDL) Bounoum Syvanpheng as saying.
</p><p>	The project is a collaborative project between EDL and the China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd., a company affiliated to the State Grid Corporation of China.
</p><p>	"When completed, the 500/230 kV transmission line project will further support the nation's electricity generation. The project will create a sustainable electricity supply for the development of Lao capital Vientiane and increase the capacity of Laos' electricity grid," said Yu Jun, general manager of the China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd., the Chinese EPC contractor.
</p><p>	"This project will be a basic and important part of economic development in the south of Laos' capital Vientiane, and is essential for agriculture, industry, services and other areas," Minister of Energy and Mines Khammany Inthirath said at a groundbreaking ceremony held in Vientiane last Friday.
</p><p>	There have so far been 61 hydropower plants in operation across the county and another 39 dams are under construction and set for completion in 2020-2021.
</p><p>	When all planned dams are put into operation, about 85 percent will be sold to other countries. Transmission lines and substations have been built to accommodate the additional power supplies.</p>"</body>
