<h2>Mercedes case will encourage Chinese consumers to protect legal rights
</h2>

<hr/><p>	The recent Mercedes-Benz oil leak scandal in Xiâan, capital of northwestern Chinaâs Shaanxi province, has settled down after the 4S dealership Xiâan Lizhixing Auto agreed to provide a replacement car and refund the 15,000-yuan financial service fee.
</p><p>	Mercedes-Benz apologized to Wang Qian, the new car owner, for her unpleasant experience, and suspended sales operations at the dealership pending an official investigation.
</p><p>	It seems that the incident is approaching a happy ending with the buyer's rights respected, the dealership investigated and hidden rules disclosed. However, the settlement deal didnât bring Chinese customers confidence in protecting their legal rights and interests.
</p><p>	The unhappy customer reportedly raised eight requests to the investigation team, including an investigation into the car's history, qualifications of pre-delivery inspection technicians, and independent inspection of the vehicle.
</p><p>	However, the settlement agreement included no response to the above requests.
</p><p>	Hearing the solution to the recent dispute, many Mercedes car owners went to the Xiâan Lizhixing Auto dealership to have their financial service fees refunded, but all requests were denied.
</p><p>	It's not the first time that Mercedes-Benz has found itself at the center of a scandal.
</p><p>	In Zhengzhou, central Chinaâs Henan province, a customer bought a Mercedes-Benz from a local dealership, but it malfunctioned within 24 hours of purchase. However, on her return, the dealership wouldn't replace the defective car.
</p><p>	Proper solutions to such cases will not only safeguard the market order, but will also protect interests on all sides.
</p><p>	Beyond the settlement deal between the car seller and customer, an investigation is required to find out who is legally responsible and whether there was any misconduct in this case.
</p><p>	In 1990, BMW was sued by Gore, a purchaser of a new car which had been painted to cover minor damage which occurred during shipping. It was later revealed that around 1,000 vehicles were sold in the US under similar circumstances.
</p><p>	Gore won $2 million in punitive damages, and the case, which has been listed a classic example by the US Supreme Court, slammed car dealers and manufacturers and protected customers.
</p><p>	Local authorities in Xiâan have launched a thorough investigation involving all car dealerships in the city, to crack down on illegal conduct and unfair competition that violate the rights and interests of the customer. </p>"</body>
