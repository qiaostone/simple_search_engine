	BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of people covered by work-related injury insurance reached 239 million in China by the end of last year, including more than 80 million migrant rural workers, a senior official announced Monday.
	The insurance has ensured the work-related injury treatment of more than 400,000 workers with occupational diseases from 2014 to 2018, said Zheng Xuanbo, director of the work-related injury insurance bureau under the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, at a press briefing.
	All their related medical expenses were fully reimbursed, which has effectively reduced their financial burden, according to Zheng.
