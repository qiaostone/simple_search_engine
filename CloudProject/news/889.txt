	BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up building an integrated platform for e-government services to offer easier access to the online services, according to the Ministry of Justice.
	The building of the integrated platform aims to standardize government services nationwide, according to an official with the ministry.
	The country will facilitate information sharing among regions and departments at various levels, the official said.
	A system will be set up to enable enterprises and individuals to evaluate the government services they received, according to the official, who added that efforts will be made to ensure the smooth operation of the integrated platform.
	In April, China's State Council made public a decree on online government services to prompt the integrated platform building.
