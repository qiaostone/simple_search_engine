At the Taipei Zoo, the two giant pandas Tuantuan (male) and Yuanyuan (female) have drawn large crowds eager to catch a glimpse of the chubby bears through the past ten years. The two giant pandas were sent to Taiwan from the Chinese mainland in late 2008. In 2013, Tuantuan and Yuanyuan had a baby called Yuanzai. (Xinhua/Zhang Guojun)
