	Pupils have lunch at Dingfan Primary School in Gaocun Township of Wanrong County, north China's Shanxi Province, May 16, 2019. Most of the 110 pupils at Dingfan Primary School are left-behind children, whose parents have become migrant workers in towns or cities. Some of the students came from registered poor families in Dingfan and nearby villages. In September of 2015, school master Zhao Yingjie applied to add the school onto the list of Free Lunch for Children (FLC), the public initiative to offer free meals to students in remote, poverty-stricken areas. From then on students in Dingfan began to enjoy their nutritious lunch at school. In order to guarantee the quality of the lunch and the transparency of the fund spending, teachers in the school take photos of the lunch dishes every day and load them onto the microblog account of the school for the public supervision.
