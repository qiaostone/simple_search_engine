	A pet hospital ambulance which runs tests and provides medical care for animals recently debuted in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province, Red Star News reported on May 19.
	The ambulance, equipped with over 10 medical facilities and a life support system, can serve as an operating room for emergency cases.
	Yan Pengcheng, a head at the pet hospital, said it cost over 600,000 yuan ($86,705) to buy and equip the ambulance.
	Yan said that as they often have to pick up pets from their homes and deal with emergency cases, they came up with the idea of a pet ambulance.
	There are two licensed veterinarians and two veterinary assistants for every on-call case which typically costs between 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan for the pet owner, he added.
	Though the ambulance service is quite expensive, a pet owner surnamed Yu said in the case of emergency it would definitely be considered.
