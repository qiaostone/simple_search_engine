	Fine products from China have entered households of countries along the Belt and Road, as the initiative has connected these countries with China through various projects, an Australian volunteer has found.
	Tim, an Australian, who worked as a volunteer in Hangzhou, interviewed foreign students from the Silk Road Research Institute of Beijing Foreign Studies University and foreigners working in Beijing.
	Angel, a girl from Malaysia who has been studying at a Beijing-based university said she always wanted to try mobile payment by herself. And nowadays her dream has come true, as people in Malaysia could pay for subway tickets and toll charges via mobile payment.
	Aliya from Azerbaijan compares the China-Europe freight trains to a Chinese high-speed railway that connects China with her hometown. She hopes that more fine products will be transported to her hometown through the rail service.
	The Belt and Road Initiative is warmly welcomed in Pakistan, said a Pakistani student named Bilal, explaining that he chose to learn in China because local companies highly value students who have learnt knowledge and skills at Chinese universities.
