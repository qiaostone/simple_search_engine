	A young couple in Hangzhou, eastern China's Zhejiang province recently went viral on Chinese social media for their "bold" move to quit their jobs to travel around China.
	The couple, named Xiaolong and Xiaoxi, both 26 years old, first quit their jobs in July 2016, as husband Xiaolong promised his wife a spur-of-the-moment trip as soon as they had saved enough money.
	They traveled over 30,000 kilometers in a car bought by Xiaolong's parents, and ended the trip at the beginning of 2017.
	"We quit our jobs not because we were rich or out of recklessness, but because we didn't want to delay our plans," Xiaolong explained.
	Before the trip ended, the couple found new jobs and their income doubled. However, they quit again in mid-2018 and spent eight months taking another trip that covered 86,000 kilometers, visiting over 90 percent of China's prefecture-level cities.
	According to Xiaolong, all the expenses, totaling around 500,000 yuan, were covered by the couple. They didn't ask for any help from their parents. "We don't freeload, and we are independent," he said.
	However, the two trips did get a negative response from potential employers, who labeled the pair as "irresponsible".
	The couple said they have no regrets, because they followed their hearts. "We broadened our horizon, and now feel at peace," Xiaolong said.
