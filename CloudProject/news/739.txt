	QALA-E-NAW, Afghanistan, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The security forces after weeks of fierce fighting were able to wipe out the militants in the restive Bala Murghab district of Afghanistan's western Badghis province and restore law and order there, said an army statement released here Saturday.
	According to the statement, the beleaguered district was utterly cleared of the armed insurgents early Saturday and the security personnel have been deployed in sensitive areas to ensure lasting peace there.
	The security forces, according to the statement, have also discovered and defused 50 explosive devices including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines during the cleanup operations in Bala Murghab district, north of provincial capital Qala-e-Naw, 555 km northwest of Kabul.
	Taliban militants who launched a massive offensive on Bala Murghab district weeks ago and captured major parts of the important area, have yet to make comment on the situation.
