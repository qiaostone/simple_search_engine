	BMW will recall 360,001 vehicles in China to replace defective airbags, according to a State Administration for Market Regulation statement.
	The recall, set to begin on Aug 30, involves 272,880 vehicles produced by BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd between Jan 2, 2014 and Oct 16, 2017, and 87,121 imported models manufactured between April 5, 2000 and Feb 21, 2018.
	A defect could cause the airbags to eject debris at passengers if deployed.
	The defective airbags were made by now-defunct Japanese supplier Takata. Founded in 1933, Takata went out of business in 2017 because of the airbag crisis.
	BMW will replace the defective airbags free of charge.
