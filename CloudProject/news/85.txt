	Many Chinese enterprises are now showing new technologies at the second Digital China Achievement Exhibition in Fuzhou, southeast Chinaâs Fujian Province, which will run until May 9.
	JD Digits, a leading digital technology company in China, announced a new intelligent stockbreeding solution, a package of digital tools for pig farming including voiceprint recognition and robots, on May 6.
	The robot can detect possible diseases based on noises made by the pigs, then provide a solution and send it to a vet, so that they can deal with the problem as quickly as possible.
	The solution can save pig farming enterprises in China more than 30 percent in labor costs and 8-10 percent of feeding costs, according to the company.
	Chinese tech giant Tencent displayed its AI-aided medical imaging and diagnosis tool, Tencent Miying, during the event. The device is capable of diagnosing over 30 types of fundus disorders by scanning eyes and then generating a report.
