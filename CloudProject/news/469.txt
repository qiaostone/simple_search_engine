	The CJ-6, originally a Chinese military trainer aircraft designed and built by Hongdu Aircraft Industry Group, has won approval to be transformed for use in the civilian aviation industry.
	A ceremony to issue the necessary Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) credentials to the CJ-6 was held at Yaohu Airport in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, on Feb 28.
	The administration issued the airworthiness approval to the CJ-6 after considering its long service period, good operation record, and the large market demand, according to Li Jian, the deputy director of the CAAC. Itâs also an innovation in the airworthiness approval field, providing references for future airworthiness approval of military aircraft.
	âThe airworthiness of the CJ-6 is of great significance for promoting the high-quality development of the aviation industry,â said Wu Xiaojun, deputy governor of the province. He believes that AVIC Hongdu, the manufacturer of the CJ-6, is leading the aviation industry in Jiangxi. He hopes that Hongdu Group will take this opportunity to accelerate production and put the aircraft into the civil market as soon as possible.
	The aircraft took to the air in 1958 and entered into service in 1962. Since then, it has racked up about 10 million flight hours, during which time, no fatal accident caused by design or manufacturing problems has been reported. Because of its moderate speed, good stability, and flexible operation, the CJ-6 has been exported to more than 10 countries around the world.
