	Chinaâs digital economy reached 27.2 trillion yuan in 2017, accounting for 32.9 percent of the countryâs GDP.
	In the era of digital economy, digital managers are indispensable for enterprises or organizations in pursuit of digitization, according to a report on digital managersâ employment prospects recently issued by the ministry.
	The report revealed that over 700,000 digital managers had been employed in sectors including IT, internet, manufacturing, construction and education in China.
