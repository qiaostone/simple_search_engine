	The Chang'e-4 probe landed at the Von Karman Crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon on January 3. The 135-kilogram rover Jade Rabbit-2 is the first ever rover to drive on the moon's far side, and is the lightest rover ever sent to the moon.
	The rover has already surpassed its expected design life, and its developers are working to ensure that it will be able to continue its lunar exploration mission and the collection of scientific data.
