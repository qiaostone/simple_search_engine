	BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposed the U.S. House of Representatives' recent passing of the "Taiwan Assurance Act of 2019" and has made stern representations to the American side, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
	The act seriously violated the one-China principle and provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, spokesman Geng Shang told a daily press briefing, saying it "rudely" interfered in China's internal affairs.
	"We urge the U.S. side to adhere to the one-China principle and provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and prevent the U.S. Congress from advancing the bill, handle Taiwan-related issues as appropriate in a bid to avoid seriously harming China-U.S. cooperation in important areas as well as peace and stability across in the Taiwan Strait," Geng stressed.
