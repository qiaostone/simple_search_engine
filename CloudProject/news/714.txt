	WELLINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was engaged to her longtime partner, Clarke Gayford, local media reported on Friday.
	The couple, who have a 10-month-old daughter, became engaged over Easter, NZ Herald quoted a spokesman for Ardern as saying.
	Ardern's press secretary said she has been wearing a ring since Easter but it has been on a middle finger, not the traditional ring finger.
