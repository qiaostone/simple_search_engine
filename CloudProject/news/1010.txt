	A 96-year-old man is dwarfing the self-assumed fashionable young people by living an abundant tech-oriented life, making him an online celebrity loved by many netizens.
	Ding Shilin, who lives in Hangzhou, eastern Chinaâs Zhejiang province, is rocking the world of so many self-proclaimed stylish 20-year-olds. His newly-purchased drone is just one of his cool new toys.
	Every day, Ding searches for new tech products, buys them online, and signs for his deliveries. His self-gained ability to operate electronic devices has assisted him in this process.
	Although his fever for tech products might seem somewhat nerdish, he is not an indoor person. Ding also enjoys traveling and photography and has traveled as far as Europe.
	But Ding also has more universal hobbies. He likes playing musical instruments, singing karaoke, and watching movies, because he used to be very involved in the cultural circle. As a retired history and music teacher, his love for cultural activities has never faded away.
