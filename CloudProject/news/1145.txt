Kunxun was born in December 2018 in Beijing at a healthy condition with 540 grams in weight and 23 centimeters in length. Kunxun was cloned from a 7-year-old female police dog named Huahuangma, which is considered a great detective dog. According to a test by a institution, Kunxun's DNA is over 99.9 percent identical to that of Huahuangma. (Xinhua)
