	BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhuanet) -- Thousands of Chinese legislators and political advisors are now gathering in the early spring Beijing for the nation's annual âtwo sessionsâ.
	This yearâs "two sessions" are the 2nd session of the 13th National Peopleâs Congress (NPC) and the 2nd session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conferences (CPPCC).
	The legislators -- NPC deputies play a role of bridge between the government and the people, the political advisors -- CPPCC members carry out consultation, supervision and participation in the deliberation of state affairs.
	Two sessions have drawn worldwide attention as they are regarded the best window to view China.
	True, the world will have a good opportunity to explore into Chinaâs major foreign and domestic policies, and specific measures it will adopt in 2019.
	By convention, two highly anticipated press conferences by the Premier and Foreign Minister will be held during the two sessions, to expound Chinaâs domestic and foreign policy and external relations.
	China will host a series of major international diplomatic events this year, including the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing China, and the second China International Import Expo, among others.
	It is expected many journalists, particularly foreign journalists, will have opportunities to ask questions, and will get satisfactory answers to their questions, from Chinese Premier, or Foreign Minister.
	Another important issue that will highlight during the period is the submitting of a draft foreign investment law to the NPC session.
	Once adopted, the unified law will replace the three existing laws on Chinese-foreign equity joint ventures, non-equity joint ventures (or contractual joint ventures) and wholly foreign-owned enterprises.
	Putting the draft to a vote itself is a timely response to the overseas investors concern and their expectation.
	The law will go a long way to help Chinaâs efforts to attract more foreign investment, protect their legitimate rights and interests, foster an environment favorable to doing business.
	And surely it will clearly demonstrate to the whole world that China is resolute to open wider and reform in deep.
	While playing an increasingly significant role on the global stage, China is experiencing great transformations.
	In this sense, the two sessions are a chance for the outside world to learn about Chinaâs development and difficulty, Chinaâs wisdom and philosophy.
	China is a big, developing country with a unique position. With a population of about 1.4 billion, it takes up 19 percent of worldâs population.
	Over the past four decades, Chinaâs GDP has increased from 0.37 trillion yuan in 1978 to over 90 trillion yuan last year.
	The tremendous progress is not just reflected in economy, but also in public service, education, healthcare, environment protection.
	As a vital platform for policy-making, the two sessions will indicate the further steps China to take on both national and international arenas.
	In another word, they will display the Chinese way of doing things and solving problems, from which the whole world can benefit.
