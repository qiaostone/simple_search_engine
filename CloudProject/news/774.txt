	Chinaâs National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has launched a regulatory app for cosmetics which enables people to search for information, read articles, and make complaints about and report relevant illegal activities, a WeChat account of China Youth Daily (IDï¼zqbcyol) reported Monday.
	The app was introduced to the public on May 20 by Chen Feng, vice director of the information center of NMPA, at the first national cosmetics safety-themed event held by NMPA in Beijing.
	The app is called âHua Zhuang Pin Jian Guanâ in Chinese, and can be literally translated as âcosmetics supervision and regulationâ. People can search for relevant information about various cosmetics by scanning the bar codes on the products or by searching the product names.
	Users of the app can read about cosmetics and get other information about the industry, including notices and new developments in supervisory and regulatory efforts concerning cosmetics.
	Users are also encouraged to report relevant illegal activities via the app.
	The new app has sparked discussion on Chinaâs major social media platforms, with many people commenting that the app is necessary, convenient and useful.
