	BEIJING, Jan. 7 (ChinaMil) -- Naval and air force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command conducted whole-process monitoring of a US warship that trespassed into Chinese territorial waters off the Xisha Islands without permission, and warned it to leave, a spokesperson of the command said on Monday.
	The USS McCampbell, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer of the US Navy, trespassed on Monday into Chinese territorial waters off the Xisha Islands without permission of the Chinese government.

	Senior colonel Li Huamin said in a statement that China has indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters, the provocation of the US warship infringed China's sovereignty, is a grave violation of Chinese law and relevant international law and also a grave threat to regional peace and stability.
	"We urge the US side immediately cease such provocative actions. The PLA Southern Theater Command will remain on high alert, closely monitor relevant maritime and air situations and resolutely safeguard China's sovereignty and security," he said.
