 (People's Daily Online)    10:36, May 05, 2019
	The 2019 China-Britain AI Summit will be held in London on the 21 June 2019. The summit will showcase innovative British and Chinese machine and deep learning technologies and explore potential synergies and avenues of cooperation. It will present a platform dedicated to fostering opportunities between China and the UK in AI.
	The summit will present panel discussions covering the AI landscape in China and the UK, investment and opportunities, AI ethics and social implications, as well as the role of AI and smart technologies in China's Belt and Road Initiative.
	The demand for the summit has arisen from AI development in both China and the UK. Chinese investment interests are looking overseas to gain technical assets and expertise. Meanwhile, the UK's start-up ecosystem continues to flourish in comparison to its European counterparts and consequentially attracts the highest interest in terms of quality talent and investment.
	It is estimated that a new AI start-up has launched in the UK every week over the past four years, with a calculated total contribution of Â£654bn to the UK economy by 2035. Indeed, it is widely accepted that British technologies and talents in the AI space are global frontrunners, even compared to their US counterparts.
	Daley, Head of AI, techUK said, "The UK has a fast-paced and vibrant AI industry, built on an extended heritage of invention. From the work of Alan Turing in the past to today's world-leading companies, the UK is leading the charge in AI innovation." (Tianxing Bai)
