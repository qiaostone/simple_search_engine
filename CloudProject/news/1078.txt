	BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Zheng Mengzhu, Chinese mainland's first test-tube baby, gave birth to a boy on Monday morning, according to the Peking University Third Hospital.
	Zheng was born on March 10, 1988 in the hospital with the help of Zhang Lizhu, a leading doctor of test tube baby research at the hospital.
	Zheng gave birth to a boy on 8:34 a.m. on Monday through a cesarean section, said Zhao Yangyu, a doctor who performed the surgery. The boy weighed 3,850 grams.
	The baby was in a horizontal position when he was in the womb, a situation that demanded a C-section, Zhao said.
	"The surgery went rather well. Both the mother and the baby are in stable condition," she said.
	Qiao Jie, head of the hospital, said the successful birth of Zheng's child marks another milestone in the history of assisted reproduction in China.
	China's test tube baby technology has reached leading levels in the world, she said.
