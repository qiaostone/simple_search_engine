	BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisor Wang Yang met with the 11th Panchen Lama Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu in Beijing Sunday.

	Wang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, fully recognized the progress made by the Panchen Lama in terms of Buddhist attainments, cultural literacy, and religious influences.
	The Panchen Lama, as a leader of Tibetan Buddhism, shoulders a great responsibility of leading Tibetan Buddhism in the right direction, and safeguarding the unification of the motherland and the ethnic solidarity, said Wang.
	Wang said he hoped the Panchen Lama will take a firm political stand and lead the religious figures and believers in fighting against all separatist elements.
	The Panchen Lama was also called on to take the lead in interpreting religious doctrines to adapt them to China's socialism and improve his religious practice and study to earn support from believers.
	The Panchen Lama said he will make his contributions to safeguarding the unification of the motherland, ethnic solidarity, social stability, and religious harmony.
	He also said he will always remember the instructions given by CPC leaders and devote himself to religious studies and practices to serve his believers.
