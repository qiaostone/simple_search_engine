	China established the state service center for veterans on Tuesdayï¼February 26thï¼, which aims to support veterans' employment, improve their welfare and guarantee their rights and interests.
	The service center for ex-servicemen will mainly help them find jobs or start up their own businesses, and assist them with preferential treatments.
	The service center for veterans will be fully established at all levels from provinces to villages in China, which reflects the government's increasing attention on the placement of ex-servicemen after the Ministry of Veterans Affairs was set up in 2018.
	China is now paying more attention to helping ex-servicemen with new jobs. For example, of the veterans who accepted government placement, more than 80 percent have been given new positions in government organs, public institutions and state-owned companies. More than 80,000 former military officers were offered civilian jobs and over 400,000 retired soldiers were resettled in 2018 by local governments, said Wang Zhiming, a spokesman for the ministry at a January press conference.
