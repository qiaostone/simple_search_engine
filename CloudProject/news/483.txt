	The Rocket Force made its debut on Feb. 14, taking the name âDongfeng Express,â a nickname coined by Chinese netizens in support of the Rocket Forceâs Dongfeng ballistic missile series, which range from short-range missiles like the DF-11 to intercontinental ones like the DF-26, the latter of which is better known as the âGuam Killer.â

	The China National Nuclear Corporationâs official Weibo account also reposted it, joking that it should share its user experience of the so-called Dongfeng Express as a major client.
	âAs a professional delivery company, it can quickly respond to customer demands. Delivery is precise and has zero mistakes. Its professionalism isnât in doubt. Only that itâs too fast; I havenât even finished this sentenceâ¦â
	The PLA Rocket Force was established on December 31, 2015, after its transformation from the previous Second Artillery Force. It is Chinaâs core strategic deterrent power, a pillar to sustain Chinaâs position as a major country and a footstone to safeguard national security, the Global Times reported, citing PLA Daily.
