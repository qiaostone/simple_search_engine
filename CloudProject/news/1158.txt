	As a new generation of mobile communication technology, 5G plays an important role in promoting the deep integration of big data, artificial intelligence, and the real economy. The cutting-edge technology is being gradually applied in various aspects in China, offering citizens more convenience and smarter technology.
	The Shanghai University of Engineering Science, for example, has introduced 5G technology onto its campus, becoming the nationâs first university equipped with the advanced network. Specifically, the Joint Innovation Laboratory of 5G + Artificial Intelligence Application has been set up to study ultra-high 8K codecs, digital copyright protection, and big data based on the AVS2 audio-video coding standard with independent intellectual property rights.
	In addition to 5G+8K ultra-high video applications, unmanned vehicles, inspections via drones, and VR high-definition video will also be put into operation soon.
	Meanwhile, the university will apply 5G technology to education and build 5G-equipped libraries and classrooms.
	Not limited to campus, 5G technology has also been applied to other fields in China.
	E-commerce giant JD.com has announced that it will build the nationâs first 5G intelligent logistics demonstration park in Shanghai, which will be equipped with automate movement, sorting, and inspection, and overall management technologies.
	In other cities like Beijing, 5G technology has already been put into operation in some places. In Yuyuantan Park, 5G technology is being used to help visitors during the season of cherry blossoms, marking the first time that 5G has been applied in a tourist site.
	The park management center is utilizing the high-speed, large-bandwidth, and low-latency characteristic of the network to solve the problems of online ticket purchases and signal congestion during the peak hours. Meanwhile, 31 high-definition AI cameras were installed to cope with the demand for temporary large-capacity expansion and ensure tourist safety.
	5G+Rural Revitalization is another highlight of the application of 5G. A 8K ultra-high-definition camera was put into service to live stream the flower festival held in Chongzhou, southwest Chinaâs Sichuan province. Visitors can also watch view the sea of flowers and historical sites from above thanks to a 5G drone.
	In addition, an online business platform was set up in Chongzhou to help locals sell local specialty agricultural products across China. Through improved traceability, customers can view a product from production to delivery.
