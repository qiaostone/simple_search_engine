	WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China "deeply regrets" that the United States has increased additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, a Chinese delegation said in a statement here early Friday.
	China will have to take necessary countermeasures, said the delegation, which is currently in Washington for the 11th round of China-U.S. high-level economic and trade consultations.
	With this round of talks still ongoing, China hopes that the United States can meet China halfway, and that the two sides will make joint efforts to resolve existing problems through cooperation and consultation, the delegation said.
