	BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday met with Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni, who is here to attend the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations (CDAC).
	Noting that China cherishes its special friendship with the Cambodian royal family, Xi said China will continue to support Cambodia in pursuing the development path suited to its own national conditions, and work with Cambodia to push their comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation to a new level.
	The two sides should well implement the action plan for building a community of shared future for China and Cambodia to deliver benefits to the two peoples, Xi said.
	China and Cambodia should set an example for countries to respect each other's cultural diversity and promote exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, he noted.
	Sihamoni said the Cambodian people will stand firmly with the Chinese people under any circumstances.
	Cambodia congratulates the People's Republic of China on the tremendous achievements it has made since its founding 70 years ago, appreciates the important role China has played in international affairs, and firmly supports the joint construction of the Belt and Road, the king said.
	The CDAC proposed by President Xi will play a major role in promoting cultural exchanges and mutual understanding among countries, Sihamoni noted.
