	GUANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A power distribution room built with 3D printing technology has started operation in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong Province.
	The electrical room, the first of its kind nationwide, measures 12.1 meters long, 4.5 meters wide and 4.6 meters high. It was built using a 3D printer according to a digital 3D model, said Wu Xiaofei with the power supply bureau in Guangzhou.
	Wu said construction of the room started last December and took a total of 35 days to complete, cutting the normal construction time by 30 percent.
	The printer only required one operator and two other workers to assist with the printing, while manual construction of the room usually requires more than five workers, he added.
	Besides, the printer reduced the dust and waste produced during the construction.
	3D printing technology will be used as an efficient, intelligent and eco-friendly way for construction as Guangzhou is ramping up efforts to expand its power supply networks, Wu said.
