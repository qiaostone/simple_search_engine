	International tech giant Amazon has announced that it will shut down its Chinese e-commerce services, which observers saw as a reflection of the fierce competition in a market buoyed by domestic giants like Alibaba and JD.com.
	In a statement on April 18, Amazon said it would shut down its services starting on July 18, adding that the plan is not a purported exit but part of a strategic transformation in China.
	âOver the past few years, we have been evolving our China online retail business to increasingly emphasize cross-border sales, and in return weâve seen very strong response from Chinese customers. Their demand for high-quality, authentic goods from around the world continues to grow rapidly, and given our global presence, Amazon is well-positioned to serve them,â the statement said.
	Amazon was one of the first services to open up the e-commerce market in China. Starting 2004, the company brought a series of international services to Chinese customers, including a well-developed logistic system and the digital reading device Kindle.
	However, under the pressure of local e-commerce companies such as Alibaba and JD.com, Amazonâs share in the Chinese market has been declining, from its high of 15.4% to 0.8% by the end of last year, Beijing News reported.
	Chinaâs e-commerce market is expected to reach $1.1 trillion in 2019, making it the worldâs first trillion-dollar e-commerce market, according to a report by Forrester.
