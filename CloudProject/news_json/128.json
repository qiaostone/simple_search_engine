However, traditional wound dressings with structural and functional defects are relatively weak in controlling bleeding and promoting regeneration of functional tissues.\n", "\tScientists from the Institute of Biophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Science and Technology Beijing have changed the traditional structure of wound dressings by creating a kind of sponge with a three-dimensional layered nanofiber sponge.\n", "\tThis sponge has a layered nanofiber structure, which increases the inter-facial interaction between the sponge and blood cells to control bleeding.\n", "\tIt is both highly compressible and resilient, providing tamponade for deep wounds and creating a dynamic microenvironment to regulate cellular behavior.\n", "\tExperiments using model mice with skin defects have shown that the sponge could effectively accelerate wound healing and reduce scar formation.\n", "\tThe research was published online in the journal Biomaterials."]}
