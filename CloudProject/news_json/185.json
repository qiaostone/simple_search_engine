And we will continue optimizing the program's overall plan as well as its capability and reliability,\" the senior researcher said. \"Over three years starting from 2020, we intend to form a drone network to display and promote its use in remote sensing and telecommunications.\"\n", "\tMeng Fanyuan, chief designer of the Feiyun system at the academy, said that the solar-powered drone has a traditional aircraft design and is made of ultralight composite materials. It is able to undertake several tasks traditionally performed by satellites, but at a much lower cost, he noted.\n", "\tWhen carrying internet-connected devices, the drone-based network will be able to link users in remote, mountainous areas and small islands via the internet, and can also provide telephonic services, he said.\n", "\tUpon Feiyun's completion, the system will be able to maintain at least one week of emergency communication services in case of failure in ground-based communications, according to the designer.\n", "\tNear space refers to the region of the Earth's atmosphere between 20 and 100 kilometers above sea level, encompassing the stratosphere, mesosphere and the lower thermosphere. It is located in altitudes above where commercial airliners fly, but below orbiting satellites.\n", "\tExperts said near space is suitable for solar-powered drones because there are no clouds at an altitude of 20 km or higher, and the airflow there is stable so drones can fully use their solar cells to generate power. As long as the solar power system works well, the aircraft can theoretically stay airborne as long as the controllers wish."]}
