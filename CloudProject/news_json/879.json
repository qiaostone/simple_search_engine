I am sure my country, Malaysia, will benefit from the projects,\" he said.\n", "\tPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan pointed out that in today's world of geopolitical uncertainty, rising inequality and trade barriers, \"the BRI offers a model of collaboration, partnership, connectivity and shared prosperity.\"\n", "\t\"Pakistan is proud to have partnered and pioneered with China in this transformation endeavor,\" he said, noting that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a major BRI cooperation project, \"has made substantial progress.\"\n", "\tWith BRI cooperation entering what Xi calls the phase of \"meticulous painting,\" the Pakistani leader called on participating countries to pay more attention to people's well-being and push for sustainable development.\n", "\tIn his remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that with the scale of its planned investments, the BRI \"offers a meaningful opportunity to contribute to the creation of a more equitable, prosperous world for all, and to reversing the negative impact of climate change.\"\n", "\tThe BRI's five pillars -- policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people exchanges -- \"are intrinsically linked to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals\" and serve as \"conceptual pillars that can be translated into real-life progress for all people,\" he added.\n", "\t\"The United Nations is poised to support the alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative with the Sustainable Development Goals, to share knowledge, and to make the most of the opportunities of this large-scale initiative for maximum sustainable development dividends,\" he said."]}
