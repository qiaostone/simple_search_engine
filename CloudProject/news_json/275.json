These obstacles will only make China stronger. Its journey toward national rejuvenation is unstoppable.\n", "\tThe confidence comes from the country's solid economic foundation and huge development potential.\n", "\tOver the past four decades, China has grown from scratch to the world's second largest economy. A country that struggled to make a single tractor has transformed into a manufacturing heavyweight in the world.\n", "\tThe \"factory of the world\" is also the \"market of the world.\" China has 1.4 billion population and a 400-million middle-income group. It has the world's most comprehensive industrial system, robust scientific and technological innovation capacity, rich human capital, and abundant land and resources. All add to the country's resilience.\n", "\tThe Chinese are people who have a great spirit of struggle. History has shown that hardships only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to fight and hone their ability to win.\n", "\tLast year, China withstood the test of trade frictions provoked by the United States. Trade continued to grow, with improved trading structure.\n", "\tIn the first quarter this year, the economy grew by 6.4 percent. China is the only major economy whose growth forecast was raised by the International Monetary Fund in its recent World Economic Outlook report.\n", "\tThe Chinese economy is a sea, not a small pond. The impact of the trade bullying measures of the United States will be overcome.\n", "\tIn the meantime, the Chinese public has also become more mature. When the news broke that Washington was hiking tariffs again, Chinese netizens overwhelmingly agreed on the stance: \"If you want to talk, the door is open; if you want to fight, we will fight to the end.\"\n", "\tA consensus has been formed -- the most important thing for China right now is to focus on its endeavors to achieve the two centenary goals and national rejuvenation.\n", "\tChina is committed to deepening reform and opening-up, pursuing high-quality economic development, further defusing major risks and safeguarding overall economic and social stability.\n", "\tArduous efforts are still required. But let it be clear that no outside forces can stop China from reaching the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation."]}
