The population of this group will rise at a compound annual growth rate of 28 percent from 2018 to 2025, taking the total number of people in China earning between 17,450 yuan and 26,180 yuan per month per household to 350 million.\n", "\tThe majority of this group, about 70 percent, will do their luxury spending overseas, a result of an increasing affinity for outbound travel and the price differential resulting from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s import tax regime and brand pricing policies.\n", "\tThe report also claimed that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post-\u00e2\u0080\u009980s/\u00e2\u0080\u009990s generations are the driving forces of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s luxury appetite. They accounted for 56 percent and 23 percent of the total spending on luxury by Chinese consumers in 2018 respectively."]}
