The two countries will harness their historical and cultural bonds forged through the ancient Silk Road as well as their geographical locations to align connectivity cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative with Italy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to develop its northern ports and the InvestItalia program, and jointly build the Belt and Road of the new era on sea, on land, in the air, in space and in the cultural domain.\n", "\tItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at a recent foreign policy seminar that Italy is willing to join the co-construction of the Belt and Road, as it will bring new opportunities to the country.\n", "\tIn fact, the co-construction of the Belt and Road will create substantial opportunities, not only for Italy, but also for the whole Europe.\n", "\tIt will create opportunities for economic revival of Europe. Upon the proposal of the BRI, the European Commission (EC) expressed its willingness to align the Juncker Plan, a 315-billion-euro investment scheme to boost private investment in European infrastructure projects, with the BRI.\n", "\tThe EC reiterated its willingness in joining the BRI in a policy paper on connectivity of the Eurasian continent it released last year.\n", "\tValuing the opportunities to be provided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and Switzerland have all joined the organization. It is an effective measure for these European countries to enhance the influence of the British pound, euro and Swiss franc.\n", "\tIn addition, the co-construction of the BRI will create opportunities for Europe to explore its unique advantages. Some European countries and cities have already become connectivity gateways or pivots under the BRI. Some of them from Eastern Europe are now the forerunners of Europe-Asia interconnectivity, gaining extra competitiveness than their European peers.\n", "\tCities such as Prague and Budapest have opened multiple air routes to China, becoming regional aviation hubs. The China-Europe freight trains are also energizing the logistics services and industries of countries and cities along the railways, making central and eastern European countries a stronger bond linking China and Europe.\n", "\tThe BRI turned Balkan countries from a powder keg into an important pivot of land-sea connectivity, and the Belgrade-Budapest railway is a great example. It also turned Azerbaijan, which was depicted as a geopolitical pivot in Zbigniew Brzezinski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book The Grand Chessboard, into a geo-economic pivot.\n", "\tIn the BRI network of connectivity, even small countries can become regional and global pivots, to promote connectivity in traditional aspects and soft connectivity of systems, policies, rules and standards, and to create connectivity in more new areas.\n", "\tThe joint construction of the Belt and Road will further facilitate the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. Based on the China-EU 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, China and the EU are negotiating on a bilateral investment pact, and going through feasibility research of an EU-China free trade agreement.\n", "\tThe BRI will provide greater energy for these efforts, and also promote the development of China-EU partnership of peace, growth, reform and civilization.\n", "\tCurrently, CHINA RAILWAY Express have made 14,000 trips between China and 49 cities in 15 European countries, linking countries together for shared development and building a new type of partnership featuring cooperation and win-win results.\n", "\tThe joint construction of the Belt and Road offers the EU an easier access to the participation of Asia-Pacific affairs.\n", "\tThe BRI brings Europe and Asia closer to each other through land- and sea-based transport links, allows Europe to take part in Asia-Pacific affairs more conveniently, increases the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capability to grasp the development opportunities of the Asia-Pacific region, and expands EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence in the region.\n", "\tThe BRI is valued by European countries. So far, 16 central and eastern European countries have signed intergovernmental memoranda of understanding on Belt and Road cooperation with China under the framework of China-central and eastern European countries cooperation. Greece, Portugal and Malta have also joined the BRI \u00e2\u0080\u009ccircle of friends\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n", "\tThe joining of these countries indicates the dividends generated by the BRI and the initiative\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rising popularity in Europe.\n", "\tIt is believed that the BRI will become a buzzword during President Xi Jinping\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upcoming state visits to Italy, Monaco and France.\n", "(Wang Yiwei is a Jean Monnet Chair Professor of the European Union, and a senior researcher at Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China)"]}
