These talks have only just recently been restarted and a late February summit date was likely picked to give them some cushion to work out substantive and logistical issues,\" he explained.\n", "\tSPECIFIC LOCATION REMAINS UNSETTLED\n", "\tWhile announcing the meeting, Trump did not give its specific location in Vietnam.\n", "\tJenna Gibson, a Korea expert at the University of Chicago, told Xinhua that it is widely speculated that the second Trump-Kim summit will take place in Da Nang, although the location has not officially been confirmed yet.\n", "\t\"Trump's team may still be working on details to make sure both sides walk in on equal footing despite the location,\" she said.\n", "\tThe expert also noted that Trump benefitted from good timing in terms of his DPRK policy.\n", "\t\"He was in office during a time when North Korea had finished its nuclear program to the point where Kim was willing to come to the negotiating table. At the same time, our ally South Korea elected a president who was very active and willing to put in the work to make progress on engagement with North Korea,\" she said. \"To his credit, Trump was willing to seize this opening, and agreed to the historic summit in Singapore last year.\"\n", "\t\"It's good to see North Korea included in this year's speech, but the amount of time Trump spent discussing his North Korea policy has shrunk significantly compared to last year,\" she said.\n", "\tTrump met with Kim first in Singapore last year on June 12, reaching several points of general consensus that have led to the improvement of the U.S.-DPRK relations. However, differences between the two sides remain over key issues including the scale of denuclearization, U.S. sanctions on the DPRK and whether to issue a war-ending declaration.\n", "\tMAJOR CHALLENGES AHEAD\n", "\tU.S. experts generally expected more substantial results from the second summit concerning trust-building and denuclearization.\n", "\tSpeaking of what the Trump administration wants to get from the meeting, Paal cited the end of conflict declaration, moderation of UN sanctions, and inspection of nuclear and missile test sites, adding that it is possible that the two sides could achieve what they want during the meeting.\n", "\tHowever, Dan Mahaffee, senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, told Xinhua that he doubts the Trump administration could find a solution that will end the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs.\n", "\tOther experts noted the importance of reciprocity in the process.\n", "\tFerrier, for his part, told Xinhua that \"going into a second summit, the Trump administration will be looking for Pyongyang to commit to taking real steps towards denuclearization, which will need to be met with reciprocal concessions from Washington.\"\n", "\tGibson, while saying that the Trump administration needs to get from the second summit \"something concrete,\" noted that \"for Trump to be successful and for this summit to be worth it both policy-wise and politically, he needs a specific change, not just a promise from Kim.\"\n", "\t\"One likely candidate for a concrete take-away is movement toward declaring an official end to the Korean War. Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, specifically mentioned that President Trump is willing to talk about such a declaration, along with other trust-building moves,\" she said."]}
