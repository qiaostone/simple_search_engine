For example, of the veterans who accepted government placement, more than 80 percent have been given new positions in government organs, public institutions and state-owned companies. More than 80,000 former military officers were offered civilian jobs and over 400,000 retired soldiers were resettled in 2018 by local governments, said Wang Zhiming, a spokesman for the ministry at a January press conference.\u00a0"]}
