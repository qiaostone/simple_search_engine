The procession was destined for those temples where the monarch paid homage to former kings of Siam (the former name of Thailand).\n", "\tThe monarch, who was crowned during Saturday's coronation rituals, was seated on a golden palaquin carried by soldiers in olden-fashioned golden hats and red dresses. In the royal procession were a total of 1,336 troops attached to the Royal Guards, palaces, army, navy, air force, police and students of Pre-cadet School.\n", "\tStriding along in the procession just below the royal palanquin were Her Majesty Queen Suthida and Her Royal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha, the monarch's eldest daughter, in black-feathered conical helmets and a red and black royal pattern.\n", "\tAll men in the royal procession took 75 synchronized strides per minute including a band of drummers and hornblowers played six instrumentals, such as Thong Chai Chalermphol March and Rajawallop March, composed by the late His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej or King Rama IX, whom King Rama X practically succeeded since late 2016.\n", "\tThousands of yellow-shirted people braved the heat of the sun and sat on both sides of the roads, including Inner Ratchadamnoen Avenue and Middle Ratchadamnoen Avenue, in Phra Nakhon's (the former name of Bangkok) inner area to view the highly-revered procession for the monarch along the route between the Grand Palace and the royal temples.
