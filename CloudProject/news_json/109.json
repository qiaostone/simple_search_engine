But by 2017, China had significantly closed the gap by reaching 76 percent of U.S. levels and surpassing the EU, according to the report.\n", "\tChinese government institutions spent more on R&D as a share of GDP than the United States, going from 84 percent of the U.S. levels in 2007 to 119 percent in 2017.\n", "\tChinese venture capital markets were extremely small in 2006, at 3.7 percent of U.S. venture capital funding. But in 2016, venture capital firms in China provided half as much funding as the firms did in the United States.\n", "\tChina's research universities scored just 9.5 percent of that of the United States in 2009, but closed the gap to 28 percent by 2018, based on the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n", "\tIn 2004, Chinese articles were cited only 62 percent as frequently as the average article was cited globally in the three years following publication, compared with 141 percent for U.S. articles.

If this growth rate were to continue, China would exceed the United States in high-tech manufacturing value-added by 2020.\n", "\tThe report concludes that considering China a copier is misconception and China can and does innovate. The report's co-author Robert Atkinson, ITIF president, calls for an American national innovation and competitiveness strategy to maintain the country's leadership."]}
