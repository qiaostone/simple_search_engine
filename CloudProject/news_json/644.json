It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a challenge for all the soldiers and officers who must work under a completely new environment and to deploy forces to combat piracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d naval expert Zhang Junshe commented.\n", "\tThe deployment of Chinese naval forces for anti-piracy missions has sped up by a factor of five over the past decade and the time required for shipborne helicopters has been shortened by three times, according to Zhang.\n", "\n", "\u00ef\u00bc\u0088Photo via PLA Daily)\n", "\tIn addition to escorting merchant ships, the escort fleets also took up various others missions, including escorting the transportation of the seventh batch of chemical weapons from Syria in September 2013. In December 2014, the fleets sent more than 600 tonnes of fresh water to the capital of Maldives when the city suffered from fresh water shortage.\n", "\tIn March 2015, a Chinese escort fleet undertook the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first evacuation of Chinese nationals overseas.

The support model is becoming more mature, with better efficiency, a China Central Television report said.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Chinese nationals travel abroad for sight-seeing and trade, overseas interests are becoming increasingly important to national interests. Therefore, the military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escort missions serve as an important guarantee for safe sea passage and overseas interests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zhang noted."]}
