So it may not last,\" Young told Xinhua in an exclusive interview Friday afternoon.\n", "\tThe improvement in the growth rate reflects temporary factors, such as the influence of additional stock-building on manufacturing output.\n", "\tWithin manufacturing, the output of the pharmaceuticals industry increased by 9.4 percent on the quarter.\n", "\tSome of this increase is likely to be associated with stock-building outside the UK ahead of the original Brexit departure date of March 29, now postponed to until Oct. 31 this year.\n", "\t\"In the most recent quarter (Q1 2019) it appears that output has been stronger as firms have produced goods to be added to stocks,\" Young said.\n", "\t\"But that may mean the output in the future will be lower when stocks are run down.\"\n", "\tThe prospects for the UK economy if Brexit goes ahead are less good than if it remains in the European Union (EU) according to Young.\n", "\t\"Brexit uncertainty has affected investment and demand since the EU referendum and reduced UK gross domestic product growth by about 2 percent relative to what it would otherwise have been,\" Young said.\n", "\t\"The long-run effect of Brexit is negative but depends on the form it takes, this is because turning away from a large, and nearby market cannot be offset by trade with more distant markets,\" he added."]}
