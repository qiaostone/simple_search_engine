Its capacity is higher but its coverage lower than the mid-band spectrum. So the mid-band spectrum can travel far to provide broader service than the high-band spectrum.\n", "\tAnother challenge for 5G service is the country's weaker infrastructure in rural areas, according to the CTIA report.\n", "\tTrump said the 5G industry in the United States would be \"private sector-driven and private sector-led,\" so the U.S. government does not have to spend lots of money.\n", "\tBut the FCC unveiled a plan to provide 20.4 billion U.S. dollars in the coming decade to connect up to 4 million rural homes and small businesses to high-speed internet.\n", "\tThis is part of FCC's three-part 5G Fast Plan, namely, spectrum freeing-up, small antennas installment and deployment of optical fiber, according to Pai.\n", "\tTrump described in his speech the building of 5G service a race that \"America must win,\" and \"will win.\"\n", "\tBut FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in her Twitter account on Friday, \"from imposing tariffs on 5G equipment to alienating allies on 5G security to falling behind the rest of the world on critical mid-band spectrum,\" the Trump administration has yet to offer a workable plan for U.S. leadership.\n", "\t\"So far this Administration's interventions on 5G have done more harm than good,\" said Rosenworcel."]}
