According to Bai, ANSO members recently clarified its vision and mission, pledging to make it an international organization with great influence in promoting, organizing and carrying out Sci-tech innovation.\n", "\tThe first 37 ANSO members have formed the ANSO Action Plan for 2019-2020. It plans to set up awards, scholarships, industry associations and joint training projects, in order to build a great mechanism and platform for sci-tech cooperation, meet common challenges and promote sustainable development.\n", "\tMeanwhile, the CAS has trained for B&R countries and regions nearly 5,000 high-level Sci-tech talents including more than 1,500 with Ph.D. or master degrees in science and engineering. Many of them have returned home and become a new force in building the B&R.\n", "\tBai said the CAS, based on the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration, has built nine overseas science and education centers in B&R countries and regions and the tenth center is currently in the works.\n", "\tHe noted that the overseas centers have become significant platforms to carry out scientific collaborative projects, helping to resolve livelihood issues in those countries and regions."]}
