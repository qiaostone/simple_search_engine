Now, they are aiming to go global.\n", "\tThis May, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest self-developed Cyber Mimic Defense (CMD) system will for the first time open itself to hackers from around the world to test its ability to withstand constant attacks for a whole year, Wu Jiangxing, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, also the founder of CMD theory, told People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily Overseas Social Media on Saturday on the sidelines of the West Lake Cybersecurity Conference in Hangzhou, east China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zhejiang province.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be unprecedented in the world. It will be like Alpha Go taking challenges from top chess players across the globe. Our CMD octopus is also up for challenges to test the theory and technological maturity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wu said.\n", "\n", "The first international hacking competition on CMD system was held in May 2018 in Nanjiang, Jiangsu province.

During the West Lake Cybersecurity Conference, a skill contest was held that offered a 4-million yuan prize for the winners.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThrough such contests, public awareness of cyber security can be raised and the students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 skills will be enhanced. It is also a good way to find talents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fan Yuan, chairman of Hangzhou-based cyber security company Dbappsecurity Co. Ltd., which undertook the conference, told People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily Overseas Social Media.\n", "\tFan also has his eyes set on hosting an international skill contest one day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs China promotes the Belt and Road Initiative, it is equally important to raise local people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness on cyber security and help train more talents as the initiative pans out with more infrastructure construction that requires cyber defense efforts too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded.\n", "\n", "Chris Anastasio (left), Mike Takahashi (middle), two international white hat hackers from the US, received top annual awards for contribution to Alibaba Security Response Center on April 19, 2019.
