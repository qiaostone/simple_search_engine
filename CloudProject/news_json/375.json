Last October, a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea just off the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killing all 189 people onboard.\n", "\tBoeing, a leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners, is under fire for the deadly crash, as the company failed to take corresponding measures after the first incident in Indonesia.\n", "\tMary Schiavo, former inspector general of the United States transportation department, said the latest disaster was \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly suspicious\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crings alarm bells in the aviation industry\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n", "\tThe crash revealed that African countries and all late developing countries currently face a dilemma of independent development. Boeing and other high-tech companies cannot pay full attention to the market characteristics of developing countries. Many believe that imperialism through the tool of high and new technology implemented by developed countries is the root cause behind these disasters.\n", "\tFor one thing, high-tech companies in developed countries have the final say in terms of technology, to which developing countries have little bargaining power and face potential difficulties in the correct operation of high-tech products.\n", "\tDeveloped countries have the final say in grounding a particular aircraft model, usually instigated by the aviation safety regulator in the country that certified the original aircraft, in this case, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). However, in this instance, the FAA took slow action.\n", "\tRidiculously, China was first to ground the jets after the latest disaster out of concerns for safety, deciding not to wait for the FAA to do so. John Strickland, head of JLS Consulting, said the move by China was \u00e2\u0080\u009cunusual\u00e2\u0080\u009d, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if there is a wider political angle to this given the US-China trade tensions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n", "\tTo avoid similar tragedies and break the monopoly of developed countries, developing countries should seek strength through unity.\n", "\tAfrican countries managed to do so. The US Congress approved the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA, to assist the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and improve economic relations between the US and the region. However, African countries signed the African Continental Free Trade Area with the goal of promoting free trade in the region.\n", "\tThis was the reason behind African countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 call to integrate the African Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2063 Agenda with the Belt and Road Initiative at the 2018 Beijing Summit for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, as China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance is expected to accelerate Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steps towards modernization.\n", "(The author is an associate research fellow of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce)\u00a0"]}
