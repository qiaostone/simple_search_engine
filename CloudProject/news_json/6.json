The Chang'e-4 probe switches to dormant mode during lunar night due to lack of solar power.\n", "\tDuring the fifth lunar day of the probe on the moon, the scientific instruments on the lander and rover worked well. A total of 6.6GB of scientific detection data has been sent to the core research team for analysis.\n", "\tAs a result of the tidal locking effect, the moon's revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, and the same side always faces Earth.\n", "\tThe far side of the moon has unique features, and scientists expect Chang'e-4 could bring breakthrough findings.\n", "\tThe scientific tasks of the Chang'e-4 mission include low-frequency radio astronomical observation, surveying the terrain and landforms, detecting the mineral composition and shallow lunar surface structure and measuring neutron radiation and neutral atoms.\n", "\tThe Chang'e-4 mission embodies China's hope to combine wisdom in space exploration with four payloads developed by the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Saudi Arabia."]}
