The plan is expected to be achieved in two months, after which construction would begin.\n", "\tAbout 10 percent of the 100,000 houses belong to the Bandar Malaysia project, which Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said last week would be resumed after being abandoned in 2017. The announcement came after the prime minister decided to resume work on the East Coast Rail Link this month.\n", "\tThe 140-billion ringgit ($34 billion) Bandar Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur is expected to attract financial institutions and companies and will become an interchange for a number of rail lines, AFP reported.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe suspended [Chinese projects] because we are the new government. So when we took over, we needed to review the projects,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kamaruddin told the Global Times.\n", "\tShe noted that after a thorough review, they found these Chinese projects \u00e2\u0080\u009creliable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the Chinese companies \"will be able to do the projects.\"\n", "\tIn the original plan, the Bandar Malaysia didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include the 10,000 affordable houses, but Kamaruddin requested their inclusion because she wants \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor people to live in the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could reduce their expenses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n", "\tShe stressed that as both governments have agreed on the two major projects, the Chinese investors should be more confident as the governments are \u00e2\u0080\u009cbacking them up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey [Chinese companies] are very excited to construct the houses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n", "\tAccording to Kamaruddin, the industrialized building system (IBS) method will be used to build the houses to cut costs. The construction of each house will be limited to less than 300,000 ringgit, according to the minister.\n", "\tKamaruddin proposed rent-for-own, which means people pay the rent for five years and on the sixth year, they will have the option to buy the house. At least 30 percent of the houses will adopt the rent-for-own mode.\n", "\tAccording to the minister, the Chinese companies will get their investment back with minimum interest five years after the completion of the construction.\n", "\tMalaysia also wants Chinese investment in infrastructure and is considering to include Huawei in developing the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smart cities, she said.\n", "\tKamaruddin said there was a time when they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a clear picture of the BRI, so they were concerned that the Chinese would come to invest and then take something from Malaysia.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a wrong perception. Now we understand the system [of the BRI], that China wants to spread its knowledge to other countries because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to help. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only because of business, but about transferring and sharing knowledge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n", "\tShe stressed that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worried about the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdebt trap. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bring Chinese investment and develop the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy. If I have this project, there will be more jobs in Malaysia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0"]}
