The exposed part of these ground fractures associated with these springs as the primary location candidates to explore Mars' habitability.\n", "\t\"Understanding Mars' evolution is crucial for understanding our own earth's long-term evolution and groundwater is a key element in this process,\" said USC research scientist Essam Heggy, also a member of MARSIS, a Mars subsurface sounding radar experiment."]}
