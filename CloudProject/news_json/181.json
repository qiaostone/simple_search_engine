Patients act out their dreams and these dream enactment behaviors consist of a constellation of features including shouting, punching, kicking, and rolling, leading to sleep related violence and injuries.\n", "\tCUHK's Faculty of Medicine, in collaboration with Sichuan University in the Chinese mainland, the University of Hong Kong, and McGill University in Canada, investigated the familial link and aggregation of RBD, also its influence on neurodegeneration.\n", "\tThe study involved 102 RBD patients and 89 healthy individuals, and their 791 first-degree relatives, including parents, siblings and offspring.\n", "\tThe study found that the first-degree relatives of RBD patients were 3-6 times more likely to suffer from a series of problems related to neurodegeneration, including RBD diagnosis, Parkinson's disease, and dementia than the first-degree relatives of the healthy controls.\n", "\tThe study also found that unaffected first-degree relatives (those without definite RBD diagnosis) carried more early signs of neurodegeneration, such as constipation and subtle motor dysfunction.\n", "\tJoyce Siu Ping Lam, honorary clinical assistant professor of CUHK's Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, said that 90 percent of the patients will eventually develop Parkinson's disease symptoms at some point 5 years after they are diagnosed RBD, a marker for neurodegeneration.\n", "\tYun Kwok Wing, chairman of CUHK's Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, said that constipation is a pre-clinical symptom of RBD and it could take 20 years to proceed to Parkinson's disease.\n", "\t\"The family members of RBD patients should be considered as a high-risk group and need monitoring for further neurodegeneration,\" Wing said, adding that the mapping of progression from the prodromal stage to a full-brown Parkinson's disease has provided an important foundation for researchers to develop targeted preventive strategies in the future, and ideally to push forward the intervention by 20 years.\n", "\tThe findings have been published in an international journal Annals of Neurology."]}
