In no way should rule-followers be punished, and this should be the bottom line of our society,\" some netizens said on Weibo.\n", "\tAs criticism mounted, CRC apologized on Saturday for the overloading problem in two trains which \"caused trouble\" for some passengers during the holiday. \"We will arrange transportation work more scientifically and strengthen order controls to guide passengers to take trains in accordance with the tickets they bought,\" CRC said.\n", "\tCRC's response also generated heated discussions. On Weibo, the topic had been read 48.79 million times and discussed 2,023 times as of 6pm on Saturday.\n", "\tSome travelers could not buy a ticket to their destination during the peak travel season so they bought a ticket for a shorter distance and planned to disembark further and pay for it on board.\n", "\tA Weibo user named Mengliren said that passengers' practice of \"buying short and traveling long\" is the result of the improper scheduling of trains by CRC.\n", "\t\"The measure is a good contingency plan for those who wished to change their destination at the last minute. But if you created a rule that allows replacement tickets and profited from it, you need to take responsibility for it rather than blame passengers.\""]}
