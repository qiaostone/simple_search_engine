For instance, the eight-wheeled rover could have a better carrying capacity and be used in building lunar scientific research station, Deng said.\n", "\tChinese experts are also developing drilling technology and research on ice detection methods on the moon, he said.\n", "\tChina recently unveiled its plan to explore an asteroid and a comet, inviting scientists around the world to participate.\n", "\tThe mission will involve exploring a near-Earth asteroid, named 2016HO3, and a main-belt comet, named 133P, according to the China National Space Administration.\n", "\tHuang Jiangchuan, a researcher from CAST and chief designer of China's Chang'e-2 probe, said China's first asteroid probe is expected to be launched before 2025.\n", "\tHe said the scientific objective of the exploration includes studying the formulation and evolution of the solar system, the role of near-Earth asteroid and main-belt comet impacts on the origin of life, and the solar system small bodies dynamics formation.\n", "\tThe target 2016HO3 has a very close relationship with Earth and is called as a \"mini moon\" or a quasi satellite of the earth, said Huang.\n", "\t\"Where is it from? What's its relationship with the earth and moon? Those are questions we want to know,\" he said.\n", "\tThe second detection target of the mission, the comet 133P, probably contains water based on observation on Earth, and the exploration will help study its volatilization mechanism.\n", "\t\"We are facing great technological challenges in exploring asteroids and comets due to the little understanding about their detailed features and high uncertainty,\" he added.\n", "\t\"Compared with Japan, Europe and the United States, China is a latecomer in the exploration of asteroids and comets. We need to go faster, and we hope the mission will have multiple goals and can satisfy scientists' curiosity,\" said Huang.\n", "\tOver the past few years, CAST has been working on the mission design, and key technologies of asteroid exploration through self-funded projects, Huang said.\n", "\t\"Due to the technology complexity, vast investment and high risks, CAST is willing to cooperate with other institutes in various ways and jointly conduct international deep space exploration for the benefit of humanity,\" said Huang.\n", "\t\"There are so many small bodies like asteroids and comets in space, but only a few have been detected. The exploration could help us prevent threat from them to the earth, as well as exploit their resources,\" Huang said.\n", "\tAthena Coustenis, an astrophysicist from the Paris Observatory, said at the symposium that European scientists have a strong interest in collaborating with China on the asteroid exploration mission."]}
