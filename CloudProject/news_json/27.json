With radar observations, we might be able to see surface details that are only a few meters in size,\" Brozovic said.\n", "\tApophis was discovered in 2004 by the U.S. astronomers. Since its discovery, optical and radar telescopes have tracked Apophis as it continues on its orbit around the Sun, so scientists know well its future trajectory.\n", "\tCurrent calculations show that Apophis still has a small chance of impacting Earth, NASA said."]}
