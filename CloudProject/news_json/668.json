The third carrier, however, uses very new technologies and has no reference, he said.\n", "\tThere is speculation that the construction is taking place at the Shanghai-based Jiangnan Shipyard, as several photos have recently emerged on Chinese social media.\n", "\tIn June, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, manufacturer of China's previous two aircraft carriers, released a photo featuring a third carrier with a flat deck, leading Chinese military observers to speculate it would be installed with an electromagnetic catapult.\n", "\tThe Liaoningand the Type 001A have jump-rack decks and use no catapult.\n", "\tLi Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times on Monday that the words \"new type\" mentioned in the Xinhua report again indicated the third aircraft carrier will be equipped with a catapult system.\n", "\tThe entire arrangement on the flight deck as well as the superstructure will be very different, too, Li said.\n", "\tA third aircraft carrier will significantly boost the People's Liberation Army Navy's capabilities, experts said.\n", "\tThe Ministry of National Defensehas yet to confirm on the building of the third aircraft carrier. However, the ministry's spokespersons said in routine press conferences in May and June that China will put the overall situation of the country into consideration when it comes to China's future plans with aircraft carriers.\n", "Newspaper headline: 3rd carrier under construction: report"]}
