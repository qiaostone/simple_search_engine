AWE showcases the latest innovations in many fields, such as 5G, smart transportation, household appliances, consumer electronics, smart home, Internet of things, artificial intelligence and so on. (Photo by Wang Gang from People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily online)\n", "\tTwo starkly different stories appeared among the tech news headlines in recent weeks. Last week, Intel abruptly announced it is giving up its 5G modem development. And on Monday, Huawei launched the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first 5G communications module for vehicles, making a formal bid to become a key supplier for self-driving autos.\n", "\tBased on these new MH5000 chips, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHuawei has developed the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first 5G car module with high speed and high quality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said in a statement.\n", "\tBy all metrics, Huawei is the global leader in 5G research and development, 5G network rollout, 5G device shipments and, increasingly, 5G penetration into home appliances like televisions and now vehicles.\n", "\tIt seems that Huawei's globally leading ICT (information and communication technology) solutions, which often combine state-of-the-art hardware with the most innovative software, are growing even more solid. Despite pressure from North America, Huawei reported a staggering 39 percent jump in business revenue in the first three months this year.\n", "\tAs a matter of fact, Huawei's technological prowess is embedded with its distinctive corporate structure, and its innovative gene has endowed it with formidable competitiveness in the marketplace.\n", "\tOf Huawei's 200,000 or so employees, about half of them own company shares, with the founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei owning only 1.3 percent. The highly dispersed and equitable distribution of Huawei's shares means the tech giant is owned by about 90,000 of its employees, who will give their best efforts to make Huawei a success.\n", "\tAs more governments in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe decide to import and deploy Huawei's advanced 5G wireless gear, and global customers form miles-long queues to buy Huawei's 5G smartphones, few would doubt the company's bright future."]}
