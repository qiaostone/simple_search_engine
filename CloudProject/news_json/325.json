According to the latest government data, the poverty rate is around 50 percent.\n", "\tThis means that the majority of citizens live on a dollar or less per day, according to World Bank standards. My village is roughly 400 km from our capital city Nairobi and 1,000 km from Mombasa, a tourist city which borders the ocean.\n", "\tBefore 2017, many people in my village had not traveled past the capital to the coastal region because the bus ride to Mombasa took 18 hours. The journey is tiresome, not forgetting that the fare is $35.\n", "\tSurprisingly, even with my exposure and education level, I had only traveled to the coast once, as part of a class tour when I was in my third year at Moi University.\n", "\n", "Aerial photo shows a train travels on the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya.

On the journey, I can observe our Tsavo National Park and see the variety of animals my country is home to.\n", "\tThe railway line has continued the good feeling in Kenya that has existed since the end of the colonial administration, despite some people being swayed by Western opinion that the government made a mistake in signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Beijing to execute the goals of the BRI.\n", "\n", "The author Victor Onyango is a journalist with the Nation Media Group (NMG) newspaper Daily Nation (Photo/Provided by\u00a0Victor Onyango)\n", "\tOne thing those chastising Kenya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision fail to comprehend is that since the project was completed, the country has welcomed more investment, and since bilateral ties between Kenya and China have deepened, the country has welcomed many Chinese tourists, with Kenya Airways opening a direct flight from Nairobi to Guangzhou.\n", "\tKenya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy has improved by 1.5 percent, and the railway has created more than 50,000 job opportunities for locals.\n", "\tWith the implementation of the BRI in Kenya, China is trying to show Kenya the way to industrialization and this proves how much China respects and values its friendship with Kenya.\n", "\tI am convinced beyond any doubt that the BRI will unlock the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrialization and infrastructural dreams, because as most developed countries have already proven, the road to industrialization begins with the upgrading of connectivity.\n", "\n", "Aerial photo shows the Nairobi railway station in Nairobi, capital of Kenya.
