Artificial intelligence identifies seismic waveforms and reduces false alarms, he noted.\n", "\tThe warning system can still be improved, experts agree.\n", "\tElectromagnetic waves travel faster than seismic waves, meaning people in areas outside the epicenter can use the time difference to protect themselves, \"but it cannot play a role in reducing disasters in the hardest-hit areas,\" Sun Shihong, a China Earthquake Networks Center researcher, told the Global Times on Sunday.\n", "\tAnd earthquake prediction remains a largely experimental topic.\n", "\tChina in 2018 began using the world's first cloud image system based on sensory technology to release more timely and reliable warnings for earthquakes.\n", "\tWang's team uses a cloud image system that involves deep-buried sensors that can detect stress and energy dynamics 8 to 20 kilometers below the surface.\n", "\t\"Earthquake prediction technology, an unsolved global and technological problem, is expected to be well tested within three years,\" Wang said.\u00a0"]}
