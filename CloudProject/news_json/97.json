The standard, using federated learning, will serve as the guideline for both institutes and governments, as more legislature bodies issue data protection-related laws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Feng, also deputy dean of Nanjing Research Center, Sinovation Ventures.\n", "\tFederated learning defines a machine learning framework that allows a collective model to be constructed from data that is distributed across data owners. This guide provides a blueprint for data usage and model building across organizations while meeting applicable privacy, security, and regulatory requirements, according to the working group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official website.\n", "\tWang Yonggang, CTO of Sinovation Ventures, Dean of AI Institute, explained that federal learning is like a safe and friendly \u00e2\u0080\u009cbridge\u00e2\u0080\u009d that guarantees the smooth exchange of data between different data owners without compromising data security and personal privacy.\n", "\tLed by Chinese scientist Yang Qiang, the working group for the standard has seen many other participating efforts from China. Of more than 30 international giants, government institutes, and universities involved in the working group, over a dozen of them are from China, including China Telecom, Tencent, JD.com, Xiaomi, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n", "\tChinese researchers have also made key contributions in key technology studies in the process, such as encryption technology in data sharing, according to Wang."]}
