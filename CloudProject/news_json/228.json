But due to many reasons, some counties saw disappointing sales, such as Baojing county.\n", "\tTo cope with the situation, the poverty alleviation team of Tencent contacted relevant departments of Baojing and e-commerce platform JD.com, and then pushed tailored advertisement to target customers. The Tencent platform also asked other e-commerce platforms to support the effort.\n", "\tThanks to customized advertising and e-commerce, nearly 50,000 kilograms of oranges were sold to over 10,000 buyers within only two days, achieving a sales volume of 280,000 yuan.\n", "\tOrange growers in Baojing entrusted the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commerce bureau to present a silk banner to Tencent for the timely and huge assistance.\n", "\tThe strategy is to create content to attract customers so that they buy the farm products on e-commerce platforms, said Chen Peng, chief director of Tencent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open content platform.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy doing this, we hope to offer as much help as we can to left-behind senior people in rural areas\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chen added.\n", "\tThe platform allows authors to produce articles, and distribute them to 9 platforms of Tencent, such as WeChat, QQ, and Tencent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video services. The successful experience in selling the oranges is a result of such operation.\n", "\tLast May, the open content platform launched a poverty alleviation program, together with the fund-raising platform of JD.com and other e-commerce platforms, in a bid to boost sales of distinctive farm products and generate revenue for farmers through advertising their farm products in pictures, videos and articles.\n", "\tChen introduces the non-profit poverty alleviation model as one in which local governments and e-commerce platforms recommend distinctive farm products to the content platform, who then visits, assesses and confirms information about the products.\n", "\tAfterwards, authors of the content platform write various articles and then distribute them to Tencent platforms so that they are recommended to the readers. Finally, interested readers will buy the products via e-commerce platforms.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to walk a new way of poverty reduction through the internet. In the process, we carefully select products, write detailed articles and adopt precision marketing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chen said.\n", "\tIn 10 months, nearly 100 distinctive agricultural products were launched under the joint efforts of the open content platform and e-commerce platforms, such as brown sugar, oranges, moon cakes, apricots, and tea leaves, which has lifted impoverished farmers and even counties out of poverty.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created more than 100 articles for these farm products, and helped generate more than 8 million yuan of income for related places. For instance, the sales value of moon cakes sold on JD.com reached 2 million yuan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chen introduced, adding that they lay great importance on this as it is related to farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interests.\n", "\tCurrently, Chen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team has offered assistance to poverty-stricken counties and cities in 10 provinces such as Yunnan, Hubei, Guizhou and Shanxi.\n", "\tThe new model has enriched internet-supported poverty alleviation. Chen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team has teamed up with relevant departments in Hubei province to help poverty-stricken villages and households sell farm products and set up their brand products. So far, 8 kinds of products such as sweet potato powder, oranges and mushrooms, have been launched online with a transaction exceeding 300,000 yuan.\u00a0"]}
