He can take enormous credit for the leadership, for the belief, for the conviction that he has shown.\"\n", "\tWhile the LNP celebrated Saturday's victory, the ALP was on Sunday left to contemplate where it went wrong and confront questions about who would be its next leader.\n", "\tShorten announced in his concession speech on Saturday that he would be stepping down as Labor leader immediately.\n", "\tAnthony Albanese, who was defeated by Shorten the last time the leadership was vacant in 2013, and Tanya Plibersek, Shorten's deputy, are considered the frontrunners while Treasury spokesman Chris Bowen, environment spokesman Tony Burke and finance spokesman Jim Chalmers will also be contenders.\n", "\tAlbanese has confirmed his candidacy while Plibersek on Sunday told the ABC she was \"certainly considering\" running."]}
