<h2>Why Fuxing bullet train do âpush-upsâ
</h2>

<hr/><p>
</p><p>	Gif photos of a Fuxing bullet train under maintenance have gone viral on Chinese social media as the giant machine goes up and down in the photo as if doing push-ups.
</p><p>	Two Fuxing bullet trains on Monday arrived in an advanced maintenance workshop in Beijing for the first level-three maintenance in the high-speed rail section of the workshop. After running for 1.2 million kilometers, the bullet trains must undergo a level-three checkup and a level-four is required after running for 2.4 million kilometers.
</p><p>	A level-three check mainly inspects the bogie, the framework that carries wheelsets. The most important part of the inspection process is to separate the vehicle from the bogie with the trainâs lifting equipment.
</p><p>	The gross weight of a Fuxing set is about 450 tonnes, which is equivalent to more than 200 automobiles. Hence, to hoist this giant, a special lift-up apparatus is deployed, which is able to support over 1,088 tonnes.
</p><p>	The short-model Fuxing train (CR400AF) has a total length of 208.95 meters, with a closely compacted vehicle bottom and bogie. During the hoist process, it is necessary to ensure that the lifting height of each train is consistent. No lapses are allowed.
</p><p>	To guarantee travel safety, Chinaâs bullet trains undergo various checkups after entering service. Level-four, the highest level of maintenance, tests the performance of each component of the entire train.</p>"</body>
