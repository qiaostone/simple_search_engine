<h2>China allows insurers to use credit derivatives
</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Xinhua)    14:12, May 19, 2019
</p>
<hr/><p>	Chinese regulators have allowed insurance companies to use credit derivatives to hedge against risks as part of efforts to encourage insurance funds to serve the real economy.
</p><p>	The purpose of using credit risk mitigation and credit protection tools should be confined to risk hedging, and insurance institutions should not be credit risk bearers, according to a notice by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).
</p><p>	The notice requires insurance companies participating in the business be capable of using the derivatives to manage risks and to comply with related trading regulations.
</p><p>	Insurance firms should monitor and assess risks at regular intervals and file monthly, quarterly and annual reports to the CBIRC.
</p><p>	Through the move, regulators hope to enable insurance funds to offer more financing support to private businesses.</p>"</body>
