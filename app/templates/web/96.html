</p><p>	China plans to launch the Chang'e-5 lunar probe by the end of this year, which is expected to bring lunar samples back to Earth, according to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of the Chang'e-4 probe and Mars probe.
</p><p>	The country will explore the polar regions of the moon to prepare for the building of a scientific moon-based research center in the future, Sun said, adding that the Long March-5 rocket will be tasked with sending the Chang'e-5 probe.
</p><p>	China will also launch its first Mars probe in 2020. Sun revealed that the countryâs Mars exploration project is well underway, and the probe will be launched as scheduled.
</p><p>	He also said that the Mars probe would be equipped with a rover, two times heavier than the Yutu-2 rover used in the Chang'e-4 probe mission.
</p><p>	The performance of the Mars exploration rover will be better than that of the rover Yutu-2, Sun said, adding that he hopes the probe will successfully land on Mars, allowing us to learn more about the Red Planet. </p>"</body>
