</p><p>	The event, which has attracted political figures, media representatives and scholars from China and all ASEAN countries, focuses mainly on Chinaâs media cooperation with ASEAN nations, after Chinese President Xi Jinping commended the role of the media in promoting the relationship between China and ASEAN nations in a congratulatory letter sent to the opening ceremony of the 2019 China-ASEAN Year of Media Exchanges in February.
</p><p>	âChina and ASEAN countries share a cultural affinity and enjoy a long-standing relationship. For the past few years, media outlets from both sides have deepened their cooperation, jointly producing multi-language documentaries and articles, as well as sharing resources and materials,â said Guo Weimin, vice minister of the State Council Information Office of China.
