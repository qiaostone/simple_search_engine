<hr/><p>	MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Investigative Committee confirmed Monday that 41 people were killed after an SSJ-100 passenger plane en route to the northwestern Russian city of Murmansk caught fire before an emergency landing Sunday at the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow.
</p><p>	"41 people died," Elena Markovskaya, representative of the committee's Moscow Interregional Investigation Department for Transport, was quoted by Tass news agency as saying.
</p><p>	The committee reported 37 survivors from the 78 people aboard the airliner in an earlier statement.
