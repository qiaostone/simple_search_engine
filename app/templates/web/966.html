</p>
<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's job market remained stable in April, seeing lower unemployment rate, official data showed Wednesday.
</p><p>	In April, the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas stood at 5 percent, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</p><p>	Specifically, the surveyed unemployment rate of population aged between 25-59 was 4.7 percent, 0.1 percentage points lower month on month.
</p><p>	The urban surveyed unemployment rate in 31 major cities stood at 5 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from March.
</p><p>	The NBS started to regularly release the monthly surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas in last April to help the government improve macro-control and provide information for formulating employment policies.
</p><p>	The surveyed urban unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of unemployed people who have participated in the employment survey in urban areas, including migrant workers in cities.
</p><p>	The surveyed urban unemployment rate was first introduced in 2014 to better reflect the job market and serve as a supplement to the registered urban unemployment rate compiled by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.</p>"</body>
