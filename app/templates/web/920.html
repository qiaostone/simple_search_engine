</p><p>	A pet hospital ambulance which runs tests and provides medical care for animals recently debuted in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province, Red Star News reported on May 19.
</p><p>	The ambulance, equipped with over 10 medical facilities and a life support system, can serve as an operating room for emergency cases.
</p><p>	Yan Pengcheng, a head at the pet hospital, said it cost over 600,000 yuan ($86,705) to buy and equip the ambulance.
</p><p>	Yan said that as they often have to pick up pets from their homes and deal with emergency cases, they came up with the idea of a pet ambulance.
</p><p>	There are two licensed veterinarians and two veterinary assistants for every on-call case which typically costs between 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan for the pet owner, he added.
</p><p>	Though the ambulance service is quite expensive, a pet owner surnamed Yu said in the case of emergency it would definitely be considered. </p>"</body>
