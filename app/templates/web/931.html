</p><p>	Just 20 days after the opening of a museum of broken relationships in Taiyuan, capital of North China's Shanxi province, its owner joked that it was turning into a blind date site, thecover.cn reported.
</p><p>	Since it opened to the public on April 25, the museum has received 500 visitors every day, aged between 16 and 25.
</p><p>	The number of its exhibits, ranging from train tickets and an unfinished self-knitted sweater to a wedding dress and a tie with a lipstick mark, has increased by threefold to more than 200. All the objects are left behind from breakups and donated by the public.
</p><p>	People seem to find closure for a broken relationship by donating souvenirs from former lover, Kang Shidong, owner of the museum, told Shanxi's news portal sxrb.com. He said a young man brought a bracelet and spent a whole afternoon writing a note, elaborating his love story.
</p><p>	Besides closure, what surprises Kang is that some visitors fell in love after coming across each other at the museum. "As far as I know, some have entered romantic relationships," said Kang. "I'm happy to see that. The purpose of establishing such a museum is for people to say goodbye to their old relationship and stride into a new one."
</p><p>	The idea of setting up such a museum came to Kang when he visited a museum of broken relationships in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province, with two friends in January. They thought it would be a good thing for Taiyuan to have a place for people to bury souvenirs from a failed relationship.
</p><p>	They acted fast and opened the museum after three months' preparation.
</p><p>	The world's first museum of broken relationships was founded in Croatia in 2006 by two artists, who ended their four-year relationship and got the idea of setting up a museum to house their leftover personal items.
</p><p>	China has several museums of broken relationships now, in Nanjing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Wuhan, Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan, Harbin, Changsha, Guangzhou and Changchun.</p>"</body>
