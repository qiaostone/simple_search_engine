<hr/><p>	MOSCOW, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Navy vessels can fire 40 hypersonic cruise Zircon missiles at a time and successfully hit U.S. military control centers, Russian retired Rear Adm. Vsevolod Khmyrov said Thursday.
</p><p>	The Zircon could reach targets 500 kilometers (311 miles) away in five minutes, Khmyrov was quoted as saying by the Sputnik news agency.
</p><p>	On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his address to Russia's Federal Assembly that the advanced hypersonic Zircon would have a speed of 9 Mach (11,000 kph or 6,900 mph) and a flight range of over 1,000 kilometers.
</p><p>	"Such a hypersonic system as Zircon penetrates practically any air defense and missile defense system," Khmyrov said. "There is no protection from it."</p>"</body>
