<hr/><p>	TRIPOLI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the clashes near the Libyan capital Tripoli between forces of the UN-backed government and the eastern-based army rose to 21, according to the Ministry of Health.
</p><p>	"Based on information from the central operation chamber of the Ministry of Health, the casualties are 21 dead and 27 injured," the ministry said.
</p><p>	The army, led by Khalifa Haftar, has launched a military campaign on Thursday to take over western Libya, particularly Tripoli where the UN-backed government is based.
</p><p>	Earlier on Sunday, spokesman of the government's forces announced launching a counter military operation against the army troops.
</p><p>	The army is allied with the eastern-based government, as the country is politically divided between western and eastern governments.
</p><p>	Libya has been struggling to make a democratic transition amid insecurity and chaos, ever since the fall of former leader Gaddafi's regime in 2011.</p>"</body>
