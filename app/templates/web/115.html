<h2>Spicy compound from chili peppers found to slow lung cancer progression: study
</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Xinhua)    10:39, April 08, 2019
</p>
<hr/><p>	A new study showed that a compound responsible for chili peppers' heat could help slow the spread of lung cancer, making it a potential treatment for lung cancer.
</p><p>	A researcher from Marshall University presented the results on Saturday at the ongoing American Society for Investigative Pathology annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.
</p><p>	"Our study suggests that the natural compound capsaicin from chili peppers could represent a novel therapy to combat metastasis in lung cancer patients," said Jamie Friedman, a doctoral candidate who performed the research in the lab of Piyali Dasgupta with Marshall University.
</p><p>	Lung cancer tend to metastasize to secondary locations like the brain, liver or bone, making them difficult to treat, according to the researchers.
</p><p>	The researchers observed that capsaicin inhibited invasion, the first step of the metastatic process, in experiments involving three lines of cultured human non-small cell lung cancer cells.
</p><p>	Also, mice with metastatic cancer that consumed capsaicin showed smaller areas of metastatic cancer cells in the lung compared to mice not receiving the treatment.
</p><p>	They found that capsaicin could inhibit activation of a protein called Src, which plays a role in the signaling that controls cell proliferation, differentiation, motility and adhesion.
</p><p>	"We hope that one day capsaicin can be used in combination with other chemotherapeutics to treat a variety of lung cancers," said Friedman.</p>"</body>
