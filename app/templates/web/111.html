</p><p>	Chinaâs home-made BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) enjoys excellent potential in the Arab region within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), according to a recent forum between China and Arab states.
</p><p>	The second China-Arab States BDS Cooperation Forum was held on April 1 and April 2 in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia.
</p><p>	During the forum, the China Satellite Navigation Office (CSNO) introduced cooperation achievements of the China-Arab States BDS/GNSS Center, the first BeiDou overseas center, which was officially inaugurated in Tunis last year to boost cooperation on navigation satellite technology.
</p><p>	According to the CSNO, more than eight BeiDou satellites have been deployed for Arab states, with positioning accuracy of less than 10 meters, to provide high-quality navigation services for the Arab region.
</p><p>	Experts from Chinaâs research institutes and enterprises also offered special technician training on BDS technology, products and services.
</p><p>	Reports confirm that since 2012, the CSNO has trained over 800 personnel from more than 40 countries in 18 short-term training courses on satellite navigation technology and application. The office has also dispatched experts to Arab states for BDS training.
</p><p>	The CSNO and the Arab Information and Communication Technologies Organization signed a joint statement at the forum to tap the potential for broader BDS application and promote in-depth China-Arab cooperation in regards to the BDS.
</p><p>	By the end of 2020, China will launch more than 10 BeiDou navigation satellites to provide a more accurate and reliable service for countries and regions along the Belt and Road, including the Arab region.</p>"</body>
