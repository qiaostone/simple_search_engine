<h2>Revised PLA rules to enhance crime prevention in the military
</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Global Times)    10:59, April 17, 2019
</p>
<hr/><p>	The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has revised its regulations to prevent crimes, including serious violent crimes and those related to firearms, in the military to enhance national security.
</p><p>	Chinese President Xi Jinping, also General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, signed an order on Monday to promulgate the new regulation, which will take effect on May 1, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
</p><p>	The newly revised regulation, with eight sections and 94 articles, stipulates measures to prevent crimes, such as serious violent crimes, those related to firearms and ammunition, as well as duty-related violations.
</p><p>	"This regulation on control of firearms and ammunition is in accord with the newly launched 100-day campaign to crack down on guns and explosives," Li Daguang, a professor at the National Defense University of the PLA, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
</p><p>	At a meeting in Beijing on April 11, the Ministry of Public Security announced the rollout of a 100-day unified action to crush and confiscate illegal guns and explosives across the country from late April to the end of July.
</p><p>	"Compared with those manufactured by the illegal private gun dealers, firearms used by the military are of higher quality and way more powerful and advanced," Li said.
</p><p>	Therefore, if crimes, especially those in relation to firearms, are not controlled in the military, it will bring unpredictable damage and loss to society, Li explained. </p>"</body>
