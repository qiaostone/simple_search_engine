<h2>Chinese university opens LEGO courses
</h2>

<hr/><p>	TIANJIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- LEGO bricks have found a place in the classroom at northern China's Tianjin University, aiming to deepen students' knowledge and understanding and foster creative thinking.
</p><p>	The LEGO course, launched in early March, was first applied to students from the university's College of Management and Economics.
</p><p>	Students poured their creative thinking into LEGO bricks. For example, a mini car built by green bricks represented new energy vehicles, and a lady with a shining diamond driving the car meant that the brand's targeted consumers were wealthy females.
</p><p>	"I can gain a deeper understanding by building LEGO models, and sharing ideas with others can trigger more insights," said student Jiang Zixiao.
</p><p>	According to teacher Shi Yingjie, the course is not a simple game of building blocks but a multi-level studying system that integrates LEGO and the elaborate organization of key points.
</p><p>	"It is appealing to students because they can probe into the subject while 'playing.' The course can cultivate students' innovative thinking, self-expression, interpersonal skills and teamwork," Shi said.
</p><p>	The LEGO course was introduced to the university by Shi Liangxing, the dean of Xuanhuai School of Entrepreneurship &Innovation. He said the course will also be applied to politics, engineering and architecture courses in the future.
</p><p>	In addition to students attending the university, teachers, middle and high school students, as well as managers from enterprises, have access to the course.
</p><p>	LEGO has been a massive hit in China since it entered the country over two decades ago. The Chinese market registered strong double-digit revenue growth in 2018 as the Danish toy giant expanded business in more cities and on e-commerce, digital and physical platforms.</p>"</body>
