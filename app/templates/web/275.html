<h2>Commentary: U.S. bullying cannot stop China from achieving rejuvenation
</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Xinhua)    08:06, May 20, 2019
</p>
<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States has once again resorted to bullying in its trade and economic relations with China.
</p><p>	Washington first recklessly raised tariffs on Chinese goods, unilaterally escalating trade disputes, and later restricted Chinese technology company Huawei from doing business in the United States.
</p><p>	But the U.S. trick of exerting extreme pressure to deter China won't work. These obstacles will only make China stronger. Its journey toward national rejuvenation is unstoppable.
</p><p>	The confidence comes from the country's solid economic foundation and huge development potential.
</p><p>	Over the past four decades, China has grown from scratch to the world's second largest economy. A country that struggled to make a single tractor has transformed into a manufacturing heavyweight in the world.
</p><p>	The "factory of the world" is also the "market of the world." China has 1.4 billion population and a 400-million middle-income group. It has the world's most comprehensive industrial system, robust scientific and technological innovation capacity, rich human capital, and abundant land and resources. All add to the country's resilience.
</p><p>	The Chinese are people who have a great spirit of struggle. History has shown that hardships only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to fight and hone their ability to win.
</p><p>	Last year, China withstood the test of trade frictions provoked by the United States. Trade continued to grow, with improved trading structure.
</p><p>	In the first quarter this year, the economy grew by 6.4 percent. China is the only major economy whose growth forecast was raised by the International Monetary Fund in its recent World Economic Outlook report.
</p><p>	The Chinese economy is a sea, not a small pond. The impact of the trade bullying measures of the United States will be overcome.
</p><p>	In the meantime, the Chinese public has also become more mature. When the news broke that Washington was hiking tariffs again, Chinese netizens overwhelmingly agreed on the stance: "If you want to talk, the door is open; if you want to fight, we will fight to the end."
</p><p>	A consensus has been formed -- the most important thing for China right now is to focus on its endeavors to achieve the two centenary goals and national rejuvenation.
</p><p>	China is committed to deepening reform and opening-up, pursuing high-quality economic development, further defusing major risks and safeguarding overall economic and social stability.
</p><p>	Arduous efforts are still required. But let it be clear that no outside forces can stop China from reaching the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.</p>"</body>
