</p><p>	The story of the oldest âwatch doctorâ in Xiâan, northwest Chinaâs Shaanxi province, has caught the eyes of many people online, leaving a deep impression with his expertise and profound love for watches.
</p><p>	Chen Shaolin, the oldest and most experienced watch doctor in the city, has worked in the watch industry for ages, including an additional 30 years after retirement.
</p><p>	Even today, Chen still has a peak amount of over 80 watches to repair per day. Being able to handle such an intense workload partly relies on his good physical health. Steady hands and still-sharp eyes are two major traits about Chen. Despite the elderly look with grey hair, he is always ready to repair another watch.
</p><p>	Netizens have left many comments online. Chen was referred to as a manifestation of craftsmanship, and people also admired his passion for his life-long career. Some even âbeggedâ for the address of his watch repair shop.
</p><p>	âI opened the shop mainly for the sake of happiness. I have been dealing with watches all my life. After retirement, I couldnât help myself. Itâs better to help out with what I can do. Itâs a very boring job in the eyes of many, but to me, itâs a great pleasure,â Chen said. </p>"</body>
