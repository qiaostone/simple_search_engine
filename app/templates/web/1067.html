</p><p>	A 96-year-old man is dwarfing the self-assumed fashionable young people by living an abundant tech-oriented life, making him an online celebrity loved by many netizens.
</p><p>	Ding Shilin, who lives in Hangzhou, eastern Chinaâs Zhejiang province, is rocking the world of so many self-proclaimed stylish 20-year-olds. His newly-purchased drone is just one of his cool new toys.
</p><p>	Every day, Ding searches for new tech products, buys them online, and signs for his deliveries. His self-gained ability to operate electronic devices has assisted him in this process.
</p><p>	Although his fever for tech products might seem somewhat nerdish, he is not an indoor person. Ding also enjoys traveling and photography and has traveled as far as Europe.
</p><p>	But Ding also has more universal hobbies. He likes playing musical instruments, singing karaoke, and watching movies, because he used to be very involved in the cultural circle. As a retired history and music teacher, his love for cultural activities has never faded away.</p>"</body>
