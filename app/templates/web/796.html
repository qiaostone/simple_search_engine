<hr/><p>	BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday called for maintenance and implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, urging relevant parties to exercise restraint and strengthen dialogue to avoid further escalation of tensions.
</p><p>	Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced on Wednesday the decision to suspend implementing some of its commitments under the deal, the Iran Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), given the United States' previous unilateral withdrawal from it.
</p><p>	Geng said China appreciates Iran's strict fulfillment of its obligations under the deal so far and firmly opposes unilateral sanctions and the so-called "long-arm jurisdiction imposed by the U.S. on Iran."
</p><p>	The Chinese side regrets that the U.S. relevant moves have further aggravated tensions over the Iran nuclear issue, Geng said.
</p><p>	"The deal should be fully and effectively implemented," Geng said, calling the multilateral agreement ratified by the United Nations Security Council "crucial to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as peace and stability of the Middle East."
</p><p>	It is the common responsibility of all relevant parties to maintain and implement the deal, the spokesperson said. "We call on relevant parties to exercise restraint and strengthen dialogue, to avoid escalating tensions."
</p><p>	China will keep in contact with relevant parties and continue to make efforts for maintaining and implementing the deal, and at the same time firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, Geng added.</p>"</body>
