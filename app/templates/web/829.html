</p><p>	TRIPOLI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 432 people have been killed and 2,069 others injured in the fighting between the UN-backed Libyan government and the east-based army in and around the capital Tripoli, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday.
</p><p>	"Since the armed conflict in Tripoli, Libya began, 432 people have died, 2,069 people have been wounded, and more than 50,000 have had to flee their homes," WHO tweeted.
</p><p>	"Every day of violence means more people killed, injured, or displaced," WHO added.
</p><p>	The east-based army, led by Khalifa Haftar, has been leading a military campaign since early April to take over Tripoli, where the UN-backed government is based.
</p><p>	During a cabinet meeting last Thursday, Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Serraj said there will be no cease-fire until the rival army forces "return to where they came from."
</p><p>	Libya has been struggling to make a democratic transition amid chaos since the fall of former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>"</body>
