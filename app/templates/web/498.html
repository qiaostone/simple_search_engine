</p><p>	The UN-backed government's forces assemble in southern part of Tripoli, capital of Lybia, to get prepared for the attacks from the eastern-based army, on April 23, 2019. The eastern-based army, led by Khalifa Haftar, has been leading a military campaign since early April to take over Tripoli from the UN-backed government. The fighting has so far killed more than 260 people, injured more than 1,200 others, and forced more than 20,000 people to flee their homes, according to the World Health Organization. (Xinhua)
