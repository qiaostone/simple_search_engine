</p><p>	PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The person in charge of checking the fire alarm did not go to the right place after Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris caught fire on April 15, French news channel BFMTV reported on Wednesday, citing a source close to the investigation.
</p><p>	The first alarm was triggered at 6:20 p.m. local time on April 15, the report said. The second alarm sounded 20 minutes later, but it was already too late since the fire has begun to spread.
</p><p>	In another development, French weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported that workers renovating Notre-Dame Cathedral had smoked on site.
</p><p>	The company in charge of scaffolding admitted to police that some of its staff had breached a smoking ban. But it denied any link with the massive fire which destroyed the cathedral's spire and roof.
</p><p>	Paris prosecutors said police conducted an investigation into "involuntary destruction by fire", Criminal motives have been ruled out.
</p><p>	Notre-Dame is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture which receives about 12 million visitors every year.</p>"</body>
