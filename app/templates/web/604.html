</h2>
<p class="one gray"> (Xinhua)    08:01, January 24, 2019
</p>
<hr/><p>	China has rolled out a host of measures to help military veterans find jobs and protect their legitimate rights and interests.
</p><p>	Local governments provided more than 80,000 former military officers with civilian jobs and helped over 400,000 retired soldiers resettle in 2018, the Ministry of Veterans Affairs said at a press conference Wednesday.
</p><p>	Moreover, China's 123 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises have mobilized and offered around 15,000 job positions to veterans last year.
</p><p>	China also granted preferential policies to ex-servicemen who set up businesses, including financial and tax benefits, said the ministry, which was unveiled in April 2018 with the aim of providing better services to veterans.
</p><p>	The ministry has strengthened the education and training for veterans to make them more competitive in the job market and provided additional benefits for job-hunters.</p>"</body>
