</p><p>	For the first time, China sent a batch of female demining operators in the 18th peacekeeping contingent to Lebanon on May 10.
</p><p>	This move has not only put female soldiers in frontline combat positions, but also answered the call of the United Nations for more female participation in peacekeeping operations in an effort to achieve gender equality.</p>"</body>
