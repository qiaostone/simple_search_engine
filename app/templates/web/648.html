</p><p>	No. 1 Defense cooperation among SCO countries
</p><p>	In April, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) defense ministersâ meeting was held in Beijing, to enhance defense cooperation.

</p><p>	No. 3 First-time participation in Russian military drill
</p><p>	For the first time, Chinese soldiers attended the military exercise codenamed Vostok-2018, or East-2018, in Russia. More than 3,200 soldiers, 900 hard units and 30 aircraft from China were involved, standing as the largest number of Chinese participants to take part in an overseas drill.
</p><p>	No. 4 China-US pragmatic cooperation
</p><p>	In the face of complicated bilateral relations, China and the United States launched a week-long humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, starting from Nov. 12. Both sides followed the consensus reached by the two heads of state, strengthening dialogues and pragmatic cooperation at all levels, to better stabilize the relationship between the two countries.
</p><p>	No. 5 China-ASEAN cooperation in defense and security
</p><p>	China, Malaysia and Thailand held their first joint military exercise this year in Malaysia, and navies from China and 10 ASEAN countries began their first joint military exercise in Southern China.
