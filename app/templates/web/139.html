</p><p>	Chinaâs first Mars simulation base, which has opened to the public, is located in Mangya city, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan autonomous prefecture in northwest China's Qinghai province.
</p><p>	The red rock area, located in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, has natural features, landscape and climate similar to those seen on Mars. The camp is named for its unique Yadan landforms, or dry areas with wind eroded landscapes.
</p><p>	A camp has been opened for educational travel purposes. The camp can accommodate 60 people in its capsules and hundreds in tents at its base. Construction started in June 2018 with a total cost of about 150 million yuan ($22.3 million).

</p><p>	In addition, an award has been set up to solicit and praise outstanding literature works related to the base. Radio stations, books and films will also feature the Mars simulation base.</p>"</body>
