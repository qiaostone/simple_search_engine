</p><p>	UNITED NATIONS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The global economy is experiencing a broad-based growth slowdown amid unresolved trade tensions, high international policy uncertainty, and softening business confidence, according to the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) mid-2019 report, released Tuesday.
</p><p>	The growth outlook in all major developed economies and most developing regions has weakened due to a confluence of both domestic and external factors, according to the report.
</p><p>	Following an expansion of 3.0 percent in 2018, world gross product growth is now projected to moderate to 2.7 percent in 2019 and 2.9 percent in 2020, reflecting a downward revision from the forecasts released in January.
</p><p>	The report identifies several downside risks that could trigger a sharper or more prolonged growth slowdown in the world economy, potentially inflicting significant damage on development progress.
</p><p>	These risks include a further escalation in trade disputes, a sudden deterioration in financial conditions, and the accelerating effects of climate change.</p>"</body>
