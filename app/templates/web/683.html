</p><p>	LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The British leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom on Wednesday resigned amid growing discontent with the prime minster's leadership, one day after the new Brexit agreement backfired.
</p><p>	Leadsom said in her resignation letter that she does not believe that Britain will be a truly sovereign country through the deal that is newly proposed.
</p><p>	"I have always maintained that a second referendum would be dangerously divisive, and I do not support the government willingly facilitating such a concession," she said. "It would risk undermining the Union, which is something I passionately want to see strengthened."
</p><p>	She said there has been such a breakdown of government processes that recent Brexit-related legislative proposals have not been properly scrutinized or approved by cabinet members.
</p><p>	Leadsom's resignation came one day after the Prime Minister Theresa May proposed her new Brexit agreement which was seriously criticized by members from both Conservative and Labor.</p>"</body>
