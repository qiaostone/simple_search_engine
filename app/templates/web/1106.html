</p><p>	Zhao Jiumei sprays fodder to feed crayfish in Chaohu City, east China's Anhui Province, on May 1, 2019. Zhao Jiumei, a 26 year-old girl from rural area of Fuyang in Anhui Province, was admitted to Anhui Agricultural University in 2013. In 2015, Zhao joined an experimental class launched by her university preparing college students to be modern and comprehensive agricultural talents. She got chances to learn systematic knowledge concerning agriculture and management. Relying on her theoretical knowledge and outstanding practical performance, Zhao succeeded to incubate her eco-agricultural company and became the general manager after graduation. Not only did she develop various business models, she also helped to lift farmers out of poverty in the neighboring areas. As a modern agricultural talent, Zhao hopes to develop the industry in an innovative way and contribute to rural rejuvenation. (Xinhua/Zhang Duan)</p>"</body>
