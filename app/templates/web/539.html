<hr/><p>	TRIPOLI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Air forces of the east-based Libyan army on Monday targeted M'etiga international airport of the capital Tripoli, as the army continues trying to take over the city, which is controlled by the UN-backed government.
</p><p>	Khalid Mas'ood, a safety officer of the airport, told Xinhua that the runway was attacked but no casualties were reported.
</p><p>	The strike suspended all flights at the airport and damaged the runway, Mas'ood said, confirming that the airport was evacuated for safety reasons.
</p><p>	The army, led by General Khalifa Haftar, on Thursday launched a military operation to take over western Libya, particularly the capital Tripoli where the UN-backed government is based.
</p><p>	On Saturday, the army threatened to attack airbases and fighter jets of the government in western Libya.
</p><p>	The fighting left 35 people killed so far and forced 2800 people to flee their homes.
</p><p>	The army is allied with the east-based government, as the country is politically divided between two governments in the west and east.
</p><p>	Libya has been struggling to make a democratic transition amid insecurity and chaos ever since the fall of former leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011.</p>"</body>
