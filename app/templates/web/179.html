<h2>Drinking sugary beverages linked with early death: study
</h2>

<hr/><p>	WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) were linked to risks of premature death, particularly death from cardiovascular diseases, according to a Harvard study published on Monday in the journal Circulation.
</p><p>	In the study, researchers analyzed data from 80,647 women and 37,716 men who answered questionnaires about lifestyle factors and health status every two years.
</p><p>	They found that carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks, fruit drinks, energy drinks, and sports drinks are the single largest source of added sugar in the U.S. diet.
</p><p>	The more SSBs a person drank, the more risks of early death from any cause increased, according to the study.
</p><p>	It showed that, compared with drinking SSBs less than once per month, drinking one to four sugary drinks per month was linked with a 1 percent increased risk; two to six per week with a 6 percent increase; one to two per day with a 14 percent increase, and two or more per day with a 21 percent increase.
</p><p>	The increased early death risk was more pronounced among women than among men, according to the study.
</p><p>	Those who drank two or more servings per day of SSBs had a 31 percent higher risk of early death from cardiovascular diseases. Each additional serving per day of SSBs was linked with a 10 percent increased higher risk of cardiovascular diseases-related death.
</p><p>	Also, among both men and women, there was a modest link between SSB consumption and early death risk from cancer.
</p><p>	"These findings are consistent with the known adverse effects of high sugar intake on metabolic risk factors and the strong evidence that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, itself a major risk factor for premature death," said Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard.</p>"</body>
