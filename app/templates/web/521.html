</p><p>	Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday that Turkey understands NATO's concerns over its procurement of the Russian S-400 air defense missiles.
</p><p>	"We are aware of NATO's concerns. It is not right to say that Turkey is not considering them," Cavusoglu said at a press conference with his Romanian and Polish counterparts in Ankara, adding that Turkey needs air defense systems urgently.
</p><p>	His remarks came after the U.S. government claimed that Turkey's adoption of Russian missiles could cause security risk on F-35 jets and NATO defense system, and threatened to suspend the sale of F-35 jets to Turkey unless it scraps the S-400 deal.
</p><p>	Cavusoglu said that Turkey offered the United States to form a working group to determine whether the S-400 missiles pose a threat to the F-35 fighter jets.
</p><p>	"There are S-400s in Syria and F-35 jets have flown over them repeatedly. If those claims are true, the missile systems would have already gathered enough information about the aircraft," Cavusoglu said.
</p><p>	Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated that Turkey's procurement of the Russian S-400 air defense systems is a national security deal, criticizing the United States for halting the F-35 deliveries.</p>"</body>
