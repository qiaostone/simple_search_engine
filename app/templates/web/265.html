</p><p>	Chinaâs booming digital economy, serving as a major engine of the countryâs economic growth, has injected fresh impetus into the implementation of its rural vitalization strategy.
</p><p>	By the end of 2018, the size of Chinaâs digital economy stood at 31 trillion yuan, accounting for one-third of the nationâs GDP, according to recent data released during a press conference for the second Digital China Summit, which will be held in early May.
</p><p>	Chinaâs rural areas are growing at a faster rate than some first and second-tier cities when it comes to digital consumption, a recently-released report explained.
</p><p>	By December 2018, 222 million people, or 26.7 percent of the online population, lived in China's rural areas, up 6.2 percent year-on-year, according to another report on Chinaâs internet development released this February.
</p><p>	Thanks to the improvement in network infrastructure in rural areas and emphasis on the rural market from e-commerce giants, the digital economy has helped to boost the countryâs rural vitalization strategy, said Huang Hao, an associate fellow from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</p><p>	For example, several famous âTaobao villagesâ, villages which have prospered thanks to Alibabaâs online shopping platform Taobao, have emerged in east Chinaâs Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian provinces in recent years. Online sales have created job opportunities for 28 million villagers.
</p><p>	Statistics showed that online retail sales in rural areas soared to 1.37 trillion yuan in 2018, up 30.4 percent year-on-year. Online sales of agricultural products amounted to 230.5 billion yuan, representing year-on-year growth of 33.8 percent.
</p><p>	China should continue to improve digital infrastructure, support e-commerce in rural areas and encourage the application of digital technology to promote the digital economy and boost the rural vitalization strategy, said Sheng Zhenzhong, deputy head of Alibabaâs research center for rural dynamics.
</p><p>	The country is also pushing forward a digital countryside strategy, which will further facilitate the development of digital economy in rural areas.</p>"</body>
