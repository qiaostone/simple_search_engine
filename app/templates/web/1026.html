</p><p>	Ran Guangjin (C) gives students instruction in Fengxiang batik painting techniques at her workshop in Duyun City, southwest China's Guizhou Province, May 6, 2019. Ran Guangjin, a former art teacher, now becomes a craftswoman who runs a workshop making Fengxiang batik in southwest China's Guizhou Province. Ran has designed a great variety of Fengxiang printing and dyeing products such as stylish and practical batik clothing and handbags. Fengxiang batik is a kind of wax painting process originated from the Miao-Bouyei Autonomous County of Huishui. Fengxiang printing and dyeing techniques belong to a long tradition rich in cultural content. With its own technical system, the art features designs and patterns that embody both the ancient and the elegant. Ran is also dedicated to promoting the passing down of this art form. She instructs local students and villagers in the Fengxiang printing and dyeing techniques for free. "I hope the young people could pay more attention to making traditional Fengxiang batik crafts, so that the skills may be carried on," said Ran. (Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)</p>"</body>
