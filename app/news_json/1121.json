But CAP1400 increased the power of AP1000 from a maximum 1,350 megawatts to 1,500 megawatts, and has its own intellectual property rights.\n", "\tCurrently, CAP1400 is regarded as \"the most advanced and safest third-generation nuclear technology\" in the world. It can cope with extreme incidents such as earthquakes, tsunamis and aircraft crashes.\n", "\tThe technology can also curb massive radiation leaks after incidents, according to the Science and Technology Daily.\n", "\tIt can also automatically operate within 72 hours without manual interference after an accident, and can work without electricity, simply relying on its own inertia and the Earth's gravity, Lu said.\n", "\tThe system received the International Atomic Energy Agency's safety approval in April 2016.\n", "\tLu noted that the features provide the technological foundation for the CAP1400 to overcome any potential major disasters.\n", "\tLu said China is also eyeing bigger foreign markets and intends to export nuclear power equipment to Europe, such as the UK.\n", "\tPakistan is currently the largest importer of Chinese nuclear technology, he said."]}
