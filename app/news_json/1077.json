While gradual reforms saw the trading of urban land evolve into a vigorous property market that became a major growth driver, land in the countryside remains largely static.\n", "\tTo narrow the urban-rural divide and promote integrated development, the government has been taking gradual steps to build a fairer mechanism to allow market transactions of rural construction land.\n", "\tWhile stressing orderly advancing of the reforms, Liu called for caution in the process to ensure that the red line of arable farmland is not to be crossed and the interests of the farmers not be hurt.\n", "\tHe also emphasized the importance of environmental protection in the unification move.\n", "\tSince the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China has made great headway in advancing urbanization and balancing development between rural and urban areas. However, barriers hindering integrated urban-rural development still exist.\n", "\tSunday's guidelines are aimed at eradicating such barriers to promote rural revitalization and speed up the modernization of agriculture and rural areas."]}
