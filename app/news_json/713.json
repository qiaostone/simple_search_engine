It is the latest state to join the camp to make abortions illegal from the time as early as of detected fetal heartbeat, around six weeks of gestation.\n", "\tSuch states include Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, Georgia, Mississippi, Iowa and North Dakota. The moves are deemed to constitute a challenge to the historic 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that grants women the right to abortion across the country.\n", "\tThe states' newly enacted abortion bans are also believed to signal a conservative tilt in many parts of the United States. Abortion is considered a hot-button issue in the upcoming 2020 presidential elections.\n", "\tThe position on the abortion issue also reflects an increasingly divided U.S. society. Recently, states like New York and Virginia relaxed restrictions on late-term abortions.\n", "\tA May 2018 Gallup poll found that 60 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal during the first trimester, and 13 percent think women should be allowed to terminate their pregnancy during the third trimester."]}
