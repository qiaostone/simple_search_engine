With the coaxial nozzle, the composition of fibers and functional design can be better guaranteed. For proof of concept, they chose two types of \u00e2\u0080\u009cinks\u00e2\u0080\u009d: one with carbon nanotubes as the conducting cores and the other with silkworm silk for insulating sheath.\n", "\tThe two types of \u00e2\u0080\u009cinks\u00e2\u0080\u009d were simultaneously injected and created different patterns on the textile: the Chinese characters for \u00e2\u0080\u009cprint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the English word \u00e2\u0080\u009csilk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and an image of a pigeon.\n", "\tDifferent from previous methods in e-textile, this new design can integrate electronic fibers on the fabric at the same time when the e-fibers are made, which greatly improves the production efficiency of the electronic fabric. It is also more convenient and scalable for wearable electronics, as it can select multiple ink combinations and integrate different functional units into the fabric at once.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope this work will inspire others to build other types of 3D printer nozzles that can generate designs with rich compositional and structural diversity and even to integrate multiple co-axial nozzles that can produce multifunctional e-textiles in one-step,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zhang was quoted as saying.\n", "\tZhang added that the team plans to design flexible, wearable hybrid materials and electronics with more properties. They also aim for new techniques to produce smart wearable systems with integrated functions, such as sensing, actuating, and communicating."]}
