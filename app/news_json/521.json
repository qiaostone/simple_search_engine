It is not right to say that Turkey is not considering them,\" Cavusoglu said at a press conference with his Romanian and Polish counterparts in Ankara, adding that Turkey needs air defense systems urgently.\n", "\tHis remarks came after the U.S. government claimed that Turkey's adoption of Russian missiles could cause security risk on F-35 jets and NATO defense system, and threatened to suspend the sale of F-35 jets to Turkey unless it scraps the S-400 deal.\n", "\tCavusoglu said that Turkey offered the United States to form a working group to determine whether the S-400 missiles pose a threat to the F-35 fighter jets.\n", "\t\"There are S-400s in Syria and F-35 jets have flown over them repeatedly. If those claims are true, the missile systems would have already gathered enough information about the aircraft,\" Cavusoglu said.\n", "\tLast week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated that Turkey's procurement of the Russian S-400 air defense systems is a national security deal, criticizing the United States for halting the F-35 deliveries."]}
