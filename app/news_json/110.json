The team led by Zhang Xuetong in SINANO with Chinese Academy of Sciences found a flexible, foldable and robust film that can achieve infrared stealth.\n", "\tThe researchers fabricated an aerogel film with good thermal insulation performance and enhanced it by coating its fibers with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a protective waterproof layer.\n", "\tPEG stores heat when it melts and releases heat when it solidifies. In simulated sunlight, the composite film covering an object soaked up heat from the sun while only slowly increasing in temperature, just like the surroundings, making the object invisible to a thermal camera.\n", "\tWhen the light was turned off to simulate night, the coating gradually surrendered its stored heat energy to match the surroundings.\n", "\t\"The new material has a wide range of applications. It can not only be used for infrared stealth but also as a heat insulator for electronic components and battery separators,\" Zhang said.\n", "\tThe findings have been published on the recent issue of the academic journal American Chemical Society."]}
