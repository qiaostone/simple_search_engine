To the contrary, it was made clear in court today that business activities by Ms. Meng were conducted openly and transparently with full knowledge of banking officials,\" Howes said.\n", "\tThe lawyers noted in court that there is no evidence to prove that Meng committed acts of deceit, dishonesty, or other fraudulent means, according to the statement.\n", "\tThe actions against Meng led to serious and repeated violations of her rights, the statement said. Her luggage was searched, her cellphone and other electronic devices were seized, and she was compelled to reveal her passwords.\n", "\tIt was revealed that the arrest of Meng violated a core principle of Canada-U.S. extradition treaty and Canada's extradition law, because the allegation she faces is not a crime in Canada, the statement said.\n", "\t\"Political factors at play during the extradition process may lead to a serious violation of justice. Ms. Meng's legitimate rights may also be harmed. Thus Ms. Meng intends to apply to this Court for a stay of the extradition proceedings,\" Howes said.\n", "\tCanadians value the rule of law, and law-enforcement officials are expected to follow the rules at all times, in all cases and for all people - citizens and visitors alike, according to the statement.\n", "\t\"We have trust in the Canadian judicial process - and we look forward to seeing Ms. Meng's freedom restored,\" Howes added.\n", "\tMeng was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, at Vancouver's airport at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition on fraud charges.\n", "\tBoth Meng and Huawei have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing."]}
