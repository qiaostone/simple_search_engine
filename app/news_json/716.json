In the video, the FPO boss and vice-chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and the FPO's group leader in parliament Johann Gudenus had a conversation with an alleged relative of a Russian \"oligarch\". The woman offers the FPO politicians support, in return Strache and Gudenus promised to award her state orders.\n", "\t\"After yesterday's video, I have to say quite honestly, enough is enough,\" Kurz said.\n", "\tPreviously, both Strache and Gudenus had resigned from all political offices. The OVP has been governing together with the FPO since 2017.\n", "\t\"The pictures show a disturbing moral picture, we are not like that, that's just not the way Austria is,\" said Van der Bellen, and the comments made in the video are a \"blatant disrespect to the citizens and I do not tolerate this disrespect.\"\n", "\tStrache had apologized for his behavior documented in the video, but stressed that there had been no illegal and unlawful acts. \"Yeah, it was stupid, it was irresponsible and it was a mistake,\" he admitted. At the same time he spoke of a \"deliberate political assassination\"."]}
