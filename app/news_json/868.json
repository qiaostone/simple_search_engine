This is the main factor that prevents any Arab states from normalizing ties with Israel,\" he said.\n", "\tThe EU, on the other hand, may not recognize Trump's moves in the region, but \"they are far from recognizing Palestine as a state,\" he added.\n", "\tEven if the U.S. peace deal does not succeed in the end, the Palestinian Authority remains \"in a tough situation,\" and Israel may declare that the failure of the deal was because of Abbas' rejection and use that as an excuse to annex parts of the West Bank, he said.\n", "\tMany Palestinians believe the worsening financial situation is a direct result of the Palestinian Authority's rejection to the U.S. sponsorship of the peace process, but more than half of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip support the Authority's boycott of the U.S. government because of its bias in favor of Israel, according to a recent poll.\n", "\tThe poll, published earlier in April by the Jerusalem Media and Commination Center (JMCC), showed 59.3 percent of people supported the boycott of the U.S. government, while 30.3 percent preferred the Palestinian leadership to be involved in diplomatic relations.\n", "\tThe poll further indicated that 65.3 percent of people think the Palestinian leadership should reject the U.S. \"Deal of the Century,\" 6.1 percent believe they should accept it, and 21.3 percent prefer to negotiate over it."]}
