The strategic alignment between China and Italy to jointly build the Belt and Road will bring benefits not only to the people of two countries, but also to the European integration and the European people at large.\n", "\tItaly is one of the founding members of the European Union (EU), and the Treaty of Rome signed 62 years ago is seen as an important milestone of European integration. China-Italy relations have always been at the forefront of Sino-EU relations.\n", "\tXi noted during his visit that China has always supported the European integration, and is willing to work with EU countries including Italy to deepen China-Europe cooperation.
