When applicants make a written pledge on their qualifications for the certification requirements and commit to bear the legal consequences for any untruthful information therein, the government departments shall process the applications without requiring for certification.\n", "\tIn this process, efforts will also be made to enhance compliance oversight via information sharing and inter-agency checks.\n", "\tIt was decided at the meeting to set up a database of applicants' credit information and a blacklist to penalize acts of untruthful pledging and incentivize honest and law-abiding firms.\n", "\tPractices tried and tested in the pilot program will be speedily promoted nationwide, as was urged at the meeting."]}
