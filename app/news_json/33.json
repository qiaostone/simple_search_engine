And by 2070, deceased users will outnumber the living on Facebook, the study said.\n", "\tInternet users leave vast volumes of online data behind when passing away, commonly referred to as digital remains.\n", "\tThe study said this phenomenon is gaining increasing attention within the academic community. Scholars of law and related areas are investigating new dilemmas arising from inheritance of digital estates and issues of posthumous online privacy.\n", "\t\"The management of our digital remains will eventually affect everyone who uses social media, since all of us will one day pass away and leave our data behind,\" Carl Ohman, lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute said.\n", "\t\"But the totality of the deceased user profiles also amounts to something larger than the sum of its parts. It is, or will at least become, part of our global digital heritage,\" he added."]}
