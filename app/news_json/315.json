The BRI has won positive feedback from the EU, stepping up European efforts to participate in the Chinese initiative.\n", "\tThe two sides reached important consensus on enhancing the synergy of the BRI and the initiatives of the EU at the 21st China-EU Summit, held on April 9, to boost connectivity between Asia and Europe.\n", "\tChina signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road cooperation with Italy, and reached consensus on cooperation under the BRI framework with other European countries including Switzerland.\n", "\tChina and the EU have synergized more development strategies. In December 2018, China issued its latest policy paper on the EU, in a bid to promote the development of the China-EU Connectivity Platform, and seek greater synergy between BRI and EU development plans, including the EU Strategy on Connecting Europe and Asia, the Investment Plan for Europe and the Trans-European Transport Networks.\n", "\tAdditionally, China-EU cooperation under the BRI framework has yielded practical outcomes. For example, China Railway Express freight trains have made over 10,000 trips. A Chinese enterprise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment in Zelezara Smederevo, Serbia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sole steel mill, created 5,000 job opportunities for local people.\n", "\tThe BRI has also provided strong support for cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), which are important partners of the initiative.\n", "\tThe 16+1 cooperation mechanism between China and 16 CEECs has also made remarkable achievements. Opposing the global trend of slowed trade growth last year, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade with CEECs saw a robust increase of more than 20 percent, hitting a record high.\n", "\tChina and Serbia have seen remarkable results in cooperation under the BRI framework. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade with Serbia rose by more than 50 percent in the past six years. The two countries signed a mutual visa exemption agreement in 2017. Last year, over 100,000 Chinese tourists visited Serbia. The value of Chinese infrastructure project contracts in Serbia also exceeded $5 billion.\n", "\tPresident Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to Europe, his first overseas visit of 2019, further enhanced mutual trust with the EU, boosted China-Europe cooperation, and reflected China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emphasis on Europe.\n", "\tThe world today is going through significant development, transformation, and change. As major participants and contributors to economic globalization, China and the EU share broad common interests in upholding world peace and stability, promoting global prosperity and sustainable development and advancing human civilization. The two sides are also indispensable partners to the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reform and development.\n", "\tLooking ahead, China and the EU will deepen mutual understanding, enhance mutual trust, identify the direction, principles and specific measures to deepen the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era, and promote the development of China-EU relations.\n", "\tUnder the BRI, China and Europe will continue to enjoy sound and steady ties and increasing bilateral practical cooperation, which will bring tangible benefits to the people of both sides.\n", "The author is a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of European Studies in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences."]}
