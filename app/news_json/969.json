Working together with other radar systems, the new radar will improve airport weather forecasts with higher accuracy and provide better real-time monitoring and early warning of low-visibility conditions.\n", "\tThe installation of two other boundary wind profiler radar systems and a low-tropospheric wind profiler radar system developed by the institute will be completed soon.\n", "\tIn addition, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation developed a new weather radar for the new airport with the latest radar technology. It has a faster scanning speed, better reliability and stronger detection ability than ordinary radar systems.\n", "\tThe radar only takes one minute to complete a scan while previous radars took around six. The new system can function for 3,000 hours, five times that of ordinary radar systems.\n", "\tAccording to its developers, the radar can detect dangerous weather, such as thunderstorms and heavy wind faster and more accurately.\n", "\tLocated 46 km south of downtown Beijing, the new airport will be put into operation in September and take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeastern suburbs.\n", "\tIt completed its first test flight of passenger planes Monday, showing that the new airport has turned its focus from infrastructure construction to operation preparations.\n", "\tThe airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2021 and 72 million by 2025."]}
