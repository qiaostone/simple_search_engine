They even relate China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance to the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cneo-colonialism\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n", "\tIn this regard, China must make a clear stand, and explain what it has done in its foreign assistance.\n", "\n", "Ethiopians study traditional Chinese bamboo weaving skills at a teaching base in Baijie township, Naxi district of Luzhou, southwest China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sichuan province, Aug.28, 2018.

China attaches no political string to its foreign assistance, and always respects the willingness and demand of the recipient countries.\n", "\tIt sticks to equal consultation and does not export the Chinese model of development, focusing on the economic and social development of the local community.

By offering support in infrastructure and productive projects to the recipient countries, China is also creating opportunities for its enterprises to go global.\n", "\tFor instance, China has become Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest trading partner since 2009. It indicates that through foreign aid, China and the recipient countries have achieved win-win results and common development.\n", "\tThe aid from western countries to developing countries often have economic and political strings attached, which has added burden to the recipients, both in history and at present.\n", "\tOn the contrary, China, by expanding cooperation and actively promoting the social and economic development of the developing countries, can enhance their capability to pay the debts.\n", "\tFacts speak louder than words. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts are well recognized by a number of developing countries. To improve the livelihood of various countries is not only China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility as a major developing country, but also a wish of the Chinese people.\n", "\t(Wang Heng is deputy director and professor of the Institute of African Studies, Zhejiang Normal University)"]}
