I think all disputes can be resolved,\" he said.\n", "\tNoting that the world has a multilateral trading system with institutions designed for all to benefit from, Harris urged all parties to \"underscore these institutions, to support these institutions, to strengthen them, and to use them to discuss the issues that have obviously caused problems between individual partners.\"\n", "\tMutually respectful trade allows all partners, regardless of their sizes, to be benefited, he said. \"That is the whole principle behind our system. And I think that principle still holds.\""]}
