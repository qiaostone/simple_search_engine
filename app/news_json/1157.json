Then they put those data onto imagery of the thrust faults captured by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).\n", "\tThe quakes' proximity to the thrust faults showed that at least eight of those quakes tend to be resulted from the movement of crustal plates instead of asteroid impacts or rumblings deep within the Moon's interior.\n", "\tThe quakes are within 31 km of faults visible in the LRO images, close enough for the team to conclude that the faults likely caused the quakes.\n", "\t\"It's quite likely that the faults are still active today. You don't often get to see active tectonics anywhere but Earth, so it's very exciting to think these faults may still be producing moonquakes,\" said Nicholas Schmerr, an assistant professor of geology at the University of Maryland, in a statement.\n", "\tThe researchers also found that six of the eight quakes happened when the Moon was at or near the apogee of its orbit, the farthest point from the Earth.\n", "\tThis is where additional tidal stress from the Earth's gravity causes a peak in the total stress on the Moon's crust, according to the study.\n", "\tThe Moon wrinkles as its interior cools and shrinks. Its crust is brittle, so the breakage resulted in thrust faults, resembling small stair-shaped cliffs or scarps."]}
