It will not leave permanent injuries or cause long-term physical problems on targets while meeting its designed goals in dispelling enemies.\n", "\tCompared to similar products in the world, the CASIC's Microwave Active Denial System is much smaller in size and lighter, according to Su.\n", "\tThe system does not come only in stationary form, but also a vehicle-mounted one which looks roughly the same as a minibus but with a radar antenna.\n", "\tOverseas customers in countries and regions along the Belt and Road have shown great interest in the product, according to the expert.\u00a0"]}
