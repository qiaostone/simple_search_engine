In high temperatures, the ceramics will act as pellets that pin the refractory metals, so they will not soften and deform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n", "\tAs a result, the material not only has a high melting point, but also valuable characteristics such as low density and high malleability, according to the Hunan Television report.\n", "\tChina launched a major hypersonic aircraft project in 2009, and most Chinese scientists considered using carbon-carbon materials instead of metals back then.\n", "\tFan was questioned for her proposal to use such a material, but she insisted on making a sample, which came into being in 2012 and showed great potential.\n", "\tAs of March, the material has been used for products in a variety of fields including aviation, space exploration, shipbuilding and national defense, Hunan Television reported.\n", "\tHypersonic aircraft is not the only area in which materials made of ceramics and refractory metals can shine, Fan said. Any field that involves extreme high temperature, such as engines, space rockets and nuclear reactors, will have a great demand for the material, Fan noted.\n", "\tChina launched the Xingkong-2 waverider hypersonic flight vehicle via a rocket in a target range located in Northwest China in August 2018.\n", "\tOn Tuesday, East China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xiamen University launched the Jiageng-1 hypersonic aircraft with a double-waverider design.\n", "\tThe test was part of the university\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project to try to quintuple the current speed of civil aircraft to achieve global direct access within two hours, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday, April 23.\n", "\tIt is unknown whether Fan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s material was used in these two cases.\u00a0"]}
