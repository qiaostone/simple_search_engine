And he indeed had a cherished Chinese paint cane in his possession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d read Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article.\n", "\tTraversing the geographical distance between the two countries, Borges and his works left shared memory for both peoples, and constituted the bond of friendship drawing them closer.\n", "\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething, however, binds us. It is not impossible that someone has premeditated this link. It is not impossible that the universe needs this link.\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote in the poem The Paint Cane.\n", "\tOver the 40-plus years, I collected more than 25,000 books, manuscripts and letters related to Borges for studies, and found that he had been crazy for the distant Chinese culture for a long time.\n", "\tI visited China in 2013 and 2017. To my surprise, I saw in a Chinese bookstore that a lot of Borges works were translated into Chinese. A friend told me that Borges is the Latin American writer who has the most translation works in China.\n", "\tThe two trips to China also allowed me to see for myself the progress made by this great country in various fields, especially in the cultural sector of my interest.\n", "\tToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China is active in book publication and literary communication. The two trips made me aware more about the importance of enhancing our friendship by strengthening cultural connections, to which end we should never stint our efforts.\n", "\tIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s encouraging for us that President Xi quoted Borges and his works in the signed article. Both Argentina and China have splendid culture. Argentina has Borges, Julio Cort\u00c3\u00a1zar and many other preeminent writers, while a lot of philosophers and poets also emerged in China over its centuries-long history course.\n", "\tThey and their works build a bridge for bilateral people-to-people and cultural exchanges, enabling the two peoples to deepen understanding and appreciate the beauties of different cultures.\n", "\tWe are eager to an intensified people-to-people and cultural exchanges between Argentina and China, and have already proposed to list Beijing as a guest city of the Buenos Aires International Book Fair in 2021. We hope more Chinese writers can come to Argentina to share the Chinese stories with Argentine readers.\n", "(By Alejandro Vaccaro, the head of the Argentine Society of Writers and author of a Spanish-edition biography for Jorge Luis Borges)"]}
