Amid the construction of the Greater Bay Area, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) aims to coordinate with south China's Guangzhou, Shenzhen, the Macao SAR and Zhuhai to develop a world-class airport cluster.\n", "GROWING MARKET FOR WORLD-CLASS AIRPORT CLUSTER\n", "\t\"The highly-growing market in the Greater Bay Area requires an airport cluster to meet the increasing demands on traveling, business, leisure amenities and so on,\" said Cheung-kwok Law, director of Aviation Policy and Research Center of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n", "\tA collective economic powerhouse in the making, the Greater Bay Area currently has a population of 70 million and a combined GDP of 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars.
