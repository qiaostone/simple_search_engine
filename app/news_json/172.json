On the key indexes of Human3.6M, Surreal, and UP-3D, the company decreased the surface error \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a main indicator to measure the algorithm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at the millimeter level.\n", "\tOn Human3.6M, for example, the surface error of human joints has dropped from 59.9mm to 46.7mm.\n", "\tIn addition, execution speed has also been cut from 100 milliseconds to just 5 milliseconds, the company added.\n", "\tWu Fan, a scientist with the company, said they are using a brand new 3D information representation model that can predict human body postures by analyzing the three primary color images and can depict the human body with over 60,000 points, China Science Daily reported.\n", "\tThe breakthrough has reduced the requirement for input images. The technology can utilize ordinary optical cameras as sensing devices, which means applications that used to face restrictions in implementation can be gradually implemented in full and related smart image applications will be promoted, according to the company."]}
