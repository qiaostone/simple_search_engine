Under the plan, China will relax restrictions on new migrants to second and third-tier cities as it plans to gradually remove limits on hukouregistration in cities by 2022.\n", "\tCai Jiming, a political and economics expert at Tsinghua University, said relaxing the hukoupolicy will promote the cross-region flow of labor, boost social productivity and increase the incomes and spending of rural residents.\n", "\t\"But the move is never meant to allow the real estate sector to experience fluctuations. Instead, only when housing prices stand at a reasonable level can migrant workers really settle down in cities,\" Cai said.\n", "\tChina has made steady progress in urbanization, as the ranks of permanent urban residents stood at 831 million at the end of 2018, up 17.9 million from the previous year, said the National Bureau of Statistics.\n", "\tLast month, the National Development and Reform Commission said it plans to increase the urbanization rate by at least 1 percentage point by the end of this year.\n", "\tOn Monday, the National Development and Reform Commission also highlighted the reform will not be carried out selectively and only targets the elite. Instead, more efforts will be made to ensure that migrant workers can benefit from the new policy.\n", "\t\"The migrant workers who have been working and living in cities for a long time with families are the focus group,\" Chen said, adding that the policy should not be misinterpreted as a way for cities to attract professional talent."]}
