The Zoo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s live animal cams require federal resources, primarily staff, to run and broadcast. They are deemed non-essential and will not stream live until the federal government reopens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n", "\tIts less popular streams have also been shut down, but the Giant Panda Cam has long been a favorite. For example, when giant panda Mei Xiang gave birth to twin panda cubs in 2015, close to a million panda fans tuned in to watch the stream.\n", "\tThe unfortunate situation is that until a deal is reached to end the shutdown, panda fans will be unable to enjoy the 24/7 live broadcast of resident giant pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Bei Bei chomping on bamboo, playing in trees, and tumbling in the grass.\n", "\tThis may seem like a trivial matter. But for some, the loss has been unbearable, and they are calling for an end to the shutdown so that they can get on with life and enjoy watching the pandas.\n", "\tSome people have even called it a step too far and are outraged at the US government for being unable to do its job and reach a deal.\n", "\tThe US government shutdown is an internal affair, so it is not really a concern for the Chinese people. But the shutdown of the panda cam has attracted a lot of attention in China and beyond.\n", "\tThe situation has also created some laughter.\n", "\tOn the English-language website of People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily Online, one reader joked that China might need to place a guard around the pandas for safe keeping and possibly live stream it to the world.\n", "\tAnother reader wondered if the giant pandas will be detained for \"spying\" and, if so, be put in a CIA black site because they may feel threatened by the intelligence of the pandas.\n", "\tSome even went further and joked that the US government might use the opportunity to comb through panda waste for alleged \"technology theft.\"\n", "\tOf course, such comments are just a joke.\n", "\tHowever, for many everyday Americans who are currently unable to even obtain a marriage license, the ongoing government shutdown is no laughing matter.\n", "\tAs the alarming situation shows, the reality is that the US government shutdown is having a real effect on the lives of everyday Americans, who are stuck in the middle of a political game being played between Congress and the White House.\n", "\tThe shutdown also highlights the disturbing level of political dysfunction in the United States, the result of a system that can be so divided and paralyzed that it is nearly impossible for the government to actually do things.\n", "\tThe loss of the Zoo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s panda cam, while relatively minor in terms of overall impact of the shutdown, is just another sign that US democracy has become what American scholar Francis Fukuyama and others have labeled as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvetocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning the US government has become dangerously ineffective.\n", "\tZhang Weiwei, a Chinese professor at Fudan University who has debated Fukuyama on such issues, has argued that the separation of powers in the United States has its weaknesses, as many vested interest groups fight against each other to block reform initiatives that are necessary for the country. As Professor Zhang has pointed out, it is getting harder to build a social consensus within the Western democratic countries. And as a result, the Western system of democracy has become more and more problematic.\n", "\t\u00a0"]}
