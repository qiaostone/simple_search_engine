Wednesday recorded a quarterly net loss of 702 million U.S. dollars, or 4.1 dollars per share, and 522 million dollars in operating loss, in 2019.\n", "\tTesla said the loss included 188 million dollars in non-recurring charges in the first three months of this year. It also incurred 67 million dollars after the electric carmaker underwent some restructuring.\n", "\tTesla posted total revenues of about 4.5 billion dollars for this quarter, down by 37 percent from 7.23 billion dollars for the same period of last year.\n", "\tThe California-based company said it ended the 2019 first quarter with 2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a reduction of 1.5 billion dollars from the end of last year.\n", "\tTesla said it produced about 63,000 Model 3 cars in this quarter, up roughly 3 percent over the same period of 2018.\n", "\tBeginning the first quarter, Tesla started to produce and deliver Model 3 vehicles for overseas markets to meet increasing demands in Europe and China, according to the company's financial report.\n", "\tTesla said it has spent the past two years in ramping up production of Model 3 cars. \"We can now build a second-generation Model 3 line in China that we expect will be at least 50 percent cheaper per unit-of-capacity than our Model 3-related lines\" in Fremont, Northern California, and at Gigafactory 1 at Reno, Nevada state.\n", "\tTesla's cash position fell from 3.7 billion dollars to 2.2 billion dollars, mainly due to a 920-million-dollar repayment of convertible notes, of which 188 million dollars negatively impacted operating cash flow.\n", "\tTesla said it expects to return to profitability in the third quarter of 2019 after it increases deliveries and cuts costs, in addition to significantly reducing losses in the second quarter."]}
