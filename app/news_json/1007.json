In 1914, the celebration was officially recognized as a national holiday in the U.S., to be celebrated on the second Sunday of May each year, this year falling on May 12.\n", "\tNear the end of the 20th century, Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day began to gain popularity in China. In the 21st century, the date has been widely accepted and celebrated by people in China.\n", "\tWhen discussing their mothers, most children remember a particular saying or catchphrase their mum often said to them when they were little. It seems that most children have also had to deal with getting teased by their mothers, no matter where in the world they are from.\n", "\tSome of these jokes can be quite harsh, for example, those mothers who joke that they picked up the wrong baby at the hospital, or as some Chinese netizens show, that they are actually adopted.\n", "\n", "There were times when I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jokes. I would ask her whether she was my biological mom. She would say with a confused look: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow would I know?

But when she breaks the bowl, she calls it \u00e2\u0080\u009cSui Sui Ping An\u00e2\u0080\u009d.( Everlasting Peace Year After Year!) Chinese often say this out loud immediately after something is accidentally broken in the house. The word \u00e5\u00b2\u0081 (Su\u00c3\u00ac, meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009cage\u00e2\u0080\u009d) is homophonous with \u00e7\u00a2\u008e (meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009cshatter\u00e2\u0080\u009d).\n", "\n", "\n", "My mom: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 8!

I love her too.\n", "\tWith Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day becoming more widely celebrated in China, kids rack their brains for gift ideas. With a growing middle class in China, children care more about whether their moms will appreciate a certain gift instead of how much it costs.\n", "\tNaturally, it is essential to take a look at what moms actually want:\n", "\n", "\n", "\tPut simply, moms want a day off from their many motherly duties.\n", "\n", "As a man, we always come home after work and lie down on the sofa, thinking about how hard a day it has been. However, we often ignore mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficulties. We think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to be a mom. In fact, we may not be able to accomplish her duties, let alone do it better than her.
