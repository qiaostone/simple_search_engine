In dangerous urban warfare, the system allows the operator to accurately shoot targets without exposing himself to hostile attackers, the report said.\n", "\tA knife gun hides bullets inside what seems to be a knife, which can be fired in close quarters combat, the report said.\n", "\n", "A Chinese soldier aims a corner shot pistol system behind a wall.

But these high-tech guns will remain exclusive to elite forces for a while because of their higher cost, he predicted.\n", "\n", "\u00e3\u0080\u0080\u00e3\u0080\u0080A Chinese soldier waves a knife but fires bullets from it.

However, it was too expensive to win bids from the US Army, Science and Technology Daily reported.\n", "\tThe QTS-11, dubbed a \"strategic rifle\" by Chinese military observers despite being a tactical weapon, gained its nickname because it not only has multiple functions and provided the strongest individual firepower in the world, but is also highly digitalized with sensors, a positioning system and a data sharing system, making it a cut above other tactical weapons, media reported.\n", "\tThese weapons being used for basic-level combat units show the PLA's modernization and informatization level, the cctv.com report said."]}
